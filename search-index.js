So, you’ve integrated your Kubernetes or OpenShift clusters and you are ready to get started. After setting up your integration with Kubernetes, you can go open the Main menu to explore your resources. You can for example start with the Services. This brings you to the service overview which shows all services running in your clusters. If you click any of the other items underneath Kubernetes you will go to the overview page of that type of resource. It will show all resources of that type in all clusters and all namespaces at first. At the right top, you have the option to filter your selection to a certain cluster and/ or namespace to see the resources for which you are responsible. At the bottom left, you find two inputs. The time-range selector. This selects the time range for all metrics, logs and events you see throughout the product. The topology-time selector. This is used to travel back to a certain moment in time to see the exact state of your systems as observed at that moment in time. You can for example filter on a certain namespace, in this case, I filter the services down to 'sock-shop' which is a demo application using different microservices written in different programming languages and using different ways of communication to act as a nice example for troubleshooting an issue. If you now click on Topology you will see the topology of the currently selected components (in this case the services of the sock-shop). In the topology, you see all resources, in this case services. If you click a component (in this case a service) it shows you the details of a service including the most important metrics, in the case of a service, for example, the latency, throughput and error rate. Next to the most important metrics the health of the component is shown and expanded if there is anything going wrong. If you click a relation you will see the detail of the relation including all components part of it. In the case of a service map you will see all components involved in the service-to-service communication. If you want to open a component to see all details of that resource (e.g. the details of this service a certain service) you can click on the 'Open Component' button from a selected component (which you then see in the Right Hand Side panel) or you can open the component by clicking on the name of the component in the overview page tab. After opening a Kubernetes resource you will get a Highlight perspective showing you all the highlights of that component. The component meta-data The actions available on the component, in the case of a service, it gives you the ability to show the Status and/ or Configuration information. If you want to see the logs you can open the pods via the related resources which give you access to the Logs. Related resources. This section shows all related resources to this resource in this case 2 other services to which it communicates and 1 pod which backs this services. The monitors sections shows you all monitors applied to this Resource including their state a the selected topology-time. The metrics section shows you all the important metrics for this service. The metrics include the selected telemetry-time interval. A health time-line for a service shows the health of this resource over time. A event time-line showing all events happening on this service over time. Let’s now explore a triggered monitor by clicking on the 'HTTP - 5xx error ratio' one.","title":"Getting Started","component":"observability","version":"next","name":"k8s-getting-started","url":"/observability/next/en/k8s-getting-started.html","titles":[{"text":"Explore your Kubernetes resources","hash":"_explore_your_kubernetes_resources","id":1}]},"3":{"id":3,"text":"When your SUSE Observability SaaS instance has been set up and configured, you will receive an email from SUSE Observability with the required login details.

For support please file a support case in SUSE Customer Center (SCC). A license key for SUSE Observability server can be obtained via the SUSE Customer Center and will be shown as \"SUSE Rancher Prime - Observability Tech Preview\" Registration Code. This license is valid until Oct, 31 2024. Before the end a license will be made available which is valid until the end of your Rancher Prime subscription. To install SUSE Observability, ensure that the nodes have enough CPU and memory capacity. Below are the specific requirements. There are different installation options available for SUSE Observability. It is possible to install SUSE Observability either in a High-Availability (HA) or single instance (non-HA) setup. The non-HA setup is recommended for testing purposes or small environments. For production environments, it is recommended to install SUSE Observability in a HA setup. The HA production setup can support from 150 up to 500 Nodes (a Node is counted as' \\ --set baseUrl='' \\ --set sizing.profile='' \\ suse-observability-values \\ suse-observability/suse-observability-values --output-dir $VALUES_DIR The baseUrl must be the URL via which SUSE Observability will be accessible to Rancher, users, and the SUSE Observability agent. The URL must include the scheme, for example https://observability.internal.mycompany.com. See also accessing SUSE Observability. The sizing.profile should be one of trial, 10-nonha, 20-nonha, 50-nonha, 100-nonha, 150-ha, 250-ha, 500-ha. Based on this profiles the sizing_values.yaml file is generated containing default sizes for the SUSE Observability resources and configuration to be deployed on an Ha or NonHa mode. E.g. 10-nonha will produce a sizing_values.yaml meant to deploy a NonHa SUSE Observability instance to observe a 10 node cluster in a Non High Available mode. Currently moving from a nonha to an ha environment is not possible, so if you expect that your environment willrequire to observe around 150 nodes then better to go with ha immediately. This command will generate a $VALUES_DIR/suse-observability-values/templates/baseConfig_values.yaml and a $VALUES_DIR/suse-observability-values/templates/sizing_values.yaml file which contains the necessary configuration for installing the SUSE Observability Helm Chart. The SUSE Observability administrator passwords will be autogenerated by the above command and are output as comments in the generated basicConfig.yaml file. The actual values contain the bcrypt hashes of those passwords so that they’re securely stored in the Helm release in the cluster. Store the generated basicConfig.yaml and sizing_values.yaml files somewhere safe. You can reuse this files for upgrades, which will save time and (more importantly) will ensure that SUSE Observability continues to use the same API key. This is desirable as it means Agents and other data providers for SUSE Observability won’t need to be updated. The files can be regenerated independently using the switches basicConfig.generate=false and sizing.generate=false to disable any of them while still keeping the previosuly generated version of the file in the output-dir. Deploy the SUSE Observability helm chart with the generated values: help_deploy.sh helm upgrade --install \\ --namespace suse-observability \\ --create-namespace \\ --values $VALUES_DIR/suse-observability-values/templates/baseConfig_values.yaml \\ --values $VALUES_DIR/suse-observability-values/templates/sizing_values.yaml \\ suse-observability \\ suse-observability/suse-observability The SUSE Observability Helm chart has support for creating an Ingress resource to make SUSE Observability accessible outside of the cluster. Follow these instructions to set that up when you have an ingress controller in the cluster. Make sure that the resulting URL uses TLS with a valid, not self-signed, certificate. If you prefer to use a load balancer instead of ingress, expose the suse-observability-router service. The URL for the loadbalancer needs to use a valid, not self-signed, TLS certificate. To install UI extensions, enable the UI extensions from the rancher UI After enabling UI extensions, follow these steps: Navigate to extensions on the rancher UI and under the \"Available\" section of extensions, you will find the Observability extension. Install the Observability extension. Once installed, on the left panel of the rancher UI, the SUSE Observability section appears. Navigate to the SUSE Observability section and select \"configurations\". In this section, you can add the SUSE Observability server details and connect it. Follow the instructions as mentioned in Obtain a service token section below and fill in the details. Log into the SUSE Observability instance. From the top left corner, select CLI. Note the API token and install SUSE Observability cli on your local machine. Create a service token by running {% code %} sts service-token create --name suse-observability-extension --roles stackstate-k8s-troubleshooter {% endcode %} In the SUSE Observability UI open the main menu and select StackPacks. Select the Kubernetes StackPack. Click on new instance and provide the cluster name of the downstream cluster which you are adding. Make sure you match the name of the Rancher cluster with the name provided here. Click install. In the list of instructions find the section that matches your cluster best Execute the instructions provided to install the agent, these can be run in the kubectl shell that you can open for your cluster via the Rancher UI. But it can also be run from a local machine if it has Helm installed and is authorized to connect to the cluster. After you install the agent, the cluster can be seen within the SUSE Observability UI as well as the SUSE Rancher - Observability UI extension. To enable Single sign-on with your own authentication provider please see here. Is it mandatory to install a SUSE Observability agent before proceeding with adding the UI extension? No this is not mandatory, the UI extension can be installed independent. Is it mandatory to install SUSE Observability Server before we proceed with UI extensions? Yes this is not mandatory since you need to provide a SUSE Observability endpoint in the configuration Can we install SUSE Observability on a local cluster or on a downstream cluster? Both options are possible. To monitor the downstream clusters, should we install the SUSE Observability agent from the app store or add a new instance from the SUSE Observability UI? Both options are possible depending on users preference. When you uninstall and reinstall the UI extensions for Observability, we noticed that service token is not deleted and is reused upon reinstallation. Whenever we uninstall the extensions, service token should be removed. This information should be deleted when the UI extensions are uninstalled. After the extensions are installed, the SUSE Observability UI opens in the same tab as the Rancher UI. You can use shift-click to open in a new tab, this will become the default behaviour The SUSE Observability Extension is only supported on 2.8.x versions and not yet on the 2.9.x version. Support for 2.9.x will be available soon. Be aware upgrading or downgrading from HA to NON-HA and visa-versa is not yet supported.","title":"SUSE Observability","component":"observability","version":"next","name":"k8s-suse-rancher-prime","url":"/observability/next/en/k8s-suse-rancher-prime.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":1},{"text":"Getting help","hash":"_getting_help","id":2},{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"_prerequisites","id":3},{"text":"License key","hash":"_license_key","id":4},{"text":"Requirements","hash":"_requirements","id":5},{"text":"Storage","hash":"_storage","id":6},{"text":"Helm","hash":"_helm","id":7},{"text":"The different components","hash":"_the_different_components","id":8},{"text":"SUSE Observability Server","hash":"_suse_observability_server","id":9},{"text":"SUSE Observability Agent","hash":"_suse_observability_agent","id":10},{"text":"Rancher Prime - Observability UI extension","hash":"_rancher_prime_observability_ui_extension","id":11},{"text":"Where to install SUSE Observability server","hash":"_where_to_install_suse_observability_server","id":12},{"text":"Pre-Installation","hash":"_pre_installation","id":13},{"text":"Installing SUSE Observability","hash":"_installing_suse_observability","id":14},{"text":"Installation","hash":"_installation","id":15},{"text":"Accessing SUSE Observability","hash":"_accessing_suse_observability","id":16},{"text":"Installing UI extensions","hash":"_installing_ui_extensions","id":17},{"text":"Obtain a service token:","hash":"_obtain_a_service_token","id":18},{"text":"Installing the SUSE Observability Agent","hash":"_installing_the_suse_observability_agent","id":19},{"text":"Single Sign On","hash":"_single_sign_on","id":20},{"text":"Frequently asked questions & Observations:","hash":"_frequently_asked_questions_observations","id":21},{"text":"Open Issues","hash":"_open_issues","id":22}]},"7":{"id":7,"text":"Users of the SaaS tenants (StackState instances) are managed with Keycloak.

To be able to communicate from your premises/cloud to the SUSE Observability SaaS, the SUSE Observability Agent needs to be able to connect to the SUSE Observability SaaS Receiver API. When your cluster is running in a private network, you might need to configure your network to allow the SUSE Observability Agent to connect to the SUSE Observability Receiver API, because your network configuration might disallow egress traffic to the internet. This page describes how to configure your network to allow to install the SUSE Observability Agent, as well as to allow the SUSE Observability Agent to communicate with the SUSE Observability Receiver API. Traffic between the SUSE Observability Agent and the SUSE Observability Receiver API is always initiated by the SUSE Observability Agent. The SUSE Observability Receiver API doesn’t initiate any traffic to the SUSE Observability Agent. The installation of the SUSE Observability Agent is done through Helm. By default the Helm Chart is configured to pull the SUSE Observability Agent container images from the Quay.io docker registry. If your network configuration disallows egress traffic to the internet, you have a number of options to install the SUSE Observability Agent: Configure your network to allow egress traffic to the Quay.io container registry from your Kubernetes cluster. Proxy the Quay.io container registry through your own container registry. Pull the Docker images into your own container registry. For option 2 and 3, you need to configure the Helm Chart to pull the SUSE Observability Agent container images from your own container registry. A guide to configure the SUSE Observability Agent Helm Chart to pull images from your own container registry can be found here.

The different parts of the SUSE Observability Agent connect to the SUSE Observability Receiver API, hosted in your tenant in, see the following diagram: All communication is done over HTTPS, using the standard HTTPS port 443. The SUSE Observability Agent uses the following endpoints to communicate with the SUSE Observability Receiver API: https://.app.stackstate.io/receiver/stsAgent - the SUSE Observability Agent sends metrics, events and topology data to the SUSE Observability Receiver API. In order to allow the SUSE Observability Agent to communicate with the SUSE Observability Receiver API, you need to configure your network to allow egress traffic to the SUSE Observability Receiver API.

They can be easily installed and uninstalled from the StackPacks page in SUSE Observability. There are two types of StackPack - Add-ons and Integrations. The available StackPack add-ons and integrations can be found on the StackPacks page in the SUSE Observability UI. StackPacks can be installed and uninstalled from the StackPacks page in SUSE Observability. Full instructions to install and uninstall the StackPack are provided. Note that: A StackPack may require manual installation steps or configuration of the external system. Please read the instructions provided carefully. When a StackPack or StackPack instance is uninstalled, all data received via the StackPack (instance) will be removed from SUSE Observability. Any (manual) configuration or installation of StackPack components in an external system may need to be uninstalled separately. Some StackPacks allow you to connect to multiple accounts on an external system. Each account is configured in a separate instance of the StackPack. For example, the AWS StackPack can connect to multiple AWS accounts and combine information from all accounts in SUSE Observability. For each account, a separate SUSE Observability instance is configured with the information required to receive data from that AWS account. When a StackPack is upgraded, any changes made to configuration items from that StackPack will be overwritten. For details, see locked configuration items. If a new StackPack version is available, an alert will be displayed on the SUSE Observability UI StackPack page and you will have the option to view the upgrade details and read the release notes.

Edit the top-level name and identifier fields. Save the export. Import the updated export file(s). The customized configuration items will now be available in SUSE Observability and can be copied to the newly installed StackPack configuration items. StackPacks contain configuration information for SUSE Observability that’s installed when the StackPack (instance) is installed. Amongst other things, this could be component templates, functions, component actions and views. When a StackPack is upgraded, the configuration items installed by the previous version of the StackPack will be overwritten by those from the newer StackPack. This means that any manual change made to these configuration items will be overwritten when the StackPack is upgraded. To prevent a user from making changes to configuration items installed by a StackPack that will be overwritten on upgrade, these configuration items are locked by default.

This page describes the general troubleshooting steps to take when debugging a health synchronization, as well as the CLI commands used, and a description of the error messages returned. When debugging the health synchronization there are some common verification steps that can be made no matter what the specific issue is: Verify that the stream exists. If you are using sub streams, verify that the substream exists. The response will also show the number of check states on the substream. This lets you know if the data is being ingested and processed. Investigate further: Stream present - Check the stream status, this will show the metrics latency of the stream and any errors. Streams / sub streams present, but there are no check states - Confirm that the payload sent to the Receiver API adheres to the health payload specification. No streams / sub streams are present - Use the CLI command below to verify that health data sent to the Receiver API is arriving in SUSE Observability: $ sts topic describe --name sts_health_sync There can be two reasons for a check state not to show on a component in SUSE Observability: The health check state hasn’t been created. Follow the general troubleshooting steps to confirm that the stream / substream has been created and that data is arriving in SUSE Observability. The health check state was created, but its topologyElementIdentifier doesn’t match any identifiers from the SUSE Observability topology. Use the CLI command show substream status to verify if there are any Check states with identifier which has no matching topology element. The main reason for this is that the latency of the health synchronization is higher than expected. Use the CLI command show stream status to confirm the latency of the stream as well as the throughput of messages and specific check operations. It may be necessary to tweak the data sent to the health synchronization, or the frequency with which data is sent. Returns a list of all current synchronized health streams and the number of sub streams included in each. $ sts health list STREAM URN | STREAM CONSISTENCY MODEL | SUB STREAM COUNT urn:health:sourceId:streamId | REPEAT_SNAPSHOTS | 1 Returns a list of all sub streams for a given stream URN, together with the number of check states in each. $ sts health list -u urn:health:sourceId:streamId SUB STREAM ID | CHECK STATE COUNT subStreamId1 | 1 subStreamId2 | 1 The stream status command returns the aggregated stream latency and throughput metrics. This is helpful when debugging why a health check takes a long time to land on the expected topology elements. It will help diagnose if the frequency of data sent to SUSE Observability should be adjusted. The output includes a section Errors for non-existing sub streams: as some errors are only relevant when a substream couldn’t be created, for example StreamMissingSubStream. Substream errors can be any of the documented error messages. $ sts health status -u urn:health:sourceId:streamId The substream status provides useful information to verify that SUSE Observability could bind check states sent from an external system to existing topology elements. This information is helpful to debug why a specific check isn’t visible on the expected topology element. $ sts health status -u urn:health:sourceId:streamId -sub-stream-urn subStreamId3 A substream status will show the metadata related to the consistency model: Repeat Snapshots - Show repeat interval and expiry Repeat States - Show repeat interval and expiry Transactional Increments - Show checkpoint offset and checkpoint batch index The substream status can be expanded to include details of matched and unmatched check states using the -t command line argument. This is helpful to identify any health states that aren’t attached to a topology element. In the example below, checkStateId2 is listed under Check states with identifier which has no matching topology element. This means that it was not possible to match the check state to a topology element with the identifier server-2. $ sts health status -u urn:health:sourceId:streamId -sub-stream-urn subStreamId3 -t The delete stream functionality is helpful while setting up a health synchronization in SUSE Observability. You can use it to experiment, delete the data and start over again clean. You can also delete a stream and drop its data when you are sure that you don’t want to keep using it. $ sts health delete -u urn:health:sourceId:streamId The clear-errors option removes all errors from a health stream. This is helpful while setting up a health synchronization in SUSE Observability, or, for the case of the TRANSACTIONAL_INCREMENTS consistency model, when some errors can’t be removed organically. For example, a request to delete a check state might raise an error if the check state isn’t known to SUSE Observability. The only way to suppress such an error would be to use the clear-errors command. $ sts health clear-error -u urn:health:sourceId:streamId Errors will be closed once the described issue has been remediated. For example a SubStreamStopWithoutStart will be closed once the health synchronization observes a start snapshot message followed by a stop snapshot message. Error Description StreamMissingSubStream Raised when the health synchronization receives messages without a previous stream setup message as start_snapshot or expiry. StreamConsistencyModelMismatch Raised when a message is received that belongs to a different consistency model than that specified when the stream was created. StreamMissingSubStream Raised when the health synchronization receives messages with a previous start snapshot in place. SubStreamRepeatIntervalTooHigh Raised when the health synchronization receives a repeat_interval_s greater than the configured max of 30 minutes. SubStreamStartWithoutStop Raised when the health synchronization receives a second message to open a snapshot when a previous snapshot was still open. SubStreamCheckStateOutsideSnapshot Raised when the health synchronization receives external check states without previously opening a snapshot. SubStreamStopWithoutStart Raised when the health synchronization receives a stop snapshot message without having started a snapshot at all. SubStreamMissingStop Raised when the health synchronization doesn’t receive a stop snapshot after time out period of two times the repeat_interval_s established in the start snapshot message. In this case an automatic stop snapshot will be applied. SubStreamExpired Raised when the health synchronization stops receiving data on a particular substream for longer than the configured expiry_interval_s. In this case, the substream will be deleted. SubStreamLateData Raised when the health synchronization doesn’t receive a complete snapshot timely based on the established repeat_interval_s.

This topic is mostly interesting for engineers who want to make a custom integration with an existing monitoring system. For out of the box monitors you can look here. Health synchronization adds existing health checks from external monitoring systems to SUSE Observability topology elements. Health data is calculated in the external monitoring system using its own data and rules, then automatically synchronized and attached to the associated topology elements in SUSE Observability. The SUSE Observability Receiver API will automatically receive and process all incoming health data. SUSE Observability doesn’t require additional configuration to enable health synchronization, however, the health data received should match the expected JSON format. Details on how to ingest health data can be found on the following pages: Ingest health data through the SUSE Observability Receiver API The health synchronization framework works as follows: Health data is sent to SUSE Observability and ingested via the Receiver API. SUSE Observability topology elements related to the ingested health checks are identified and bound based on: the topology identifiers obtained during topology synchronization. the topologyElementIdentifier from the ingested health payload. SUSE Observability keeps track of changes to both topology elements and health checks to maintain up-to-date information. SUSE Observability health synchronization relies on different consistency models to guarantee that the data sent from an external monitoring system matches with what SUSE Observability ingests and shows. The consistency model is specified in the \"health\" property of the common JSON object or as an argument in the SUSE Observability CLI when health data is sent to SUSE Observability. The supported models are: REPEAT_SNAPSHOTS, REPEAT_STATES and TRANSACTIONAL_INCREMENTS. {% tabs %} {% tab title=\"Repeat snapshots model\" %} The REPEAT_SNAPSHOTS consistency model works with periodic, full snapshots of all checks in an external monitoring system. SUSE Observability keeps track of the checks in each received snapshot and decides if associated external check states need to be created, updated or deleted in SUSE Observability. For example, if a check state is no longer present in a snapshot. This model offers full control over which external checks will be deleted as all decisions are inferred from the received snapshots. There is no ambiguity over the external checks that will be present in SUSE Observability. Use this model when: The external monitoring system is capable of keeping the state of which elements are present in a determined time window and therefore can communicate how the full snapshot looks like. JSON payload: The Repeat Snapshots health payload accepts specific properties to specify when a snapshot starts or stops. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Repeat States model\" %} The REPEAT_STATES consistency model works with periodic checks received from an external monitoring system. SUSE Observability keeps track of the checks and decides if associated external checks need to be created or updated in SUSE Observability. A configurable expiry mechanism is used to delete external checks that aren’t observed anymore. This model offers less control over data than the REPEAT_SNAPSHOTS model. As an expiry configuration is used to delete external checks, it might happen that elements are deleted due to barely missing the expiry timeout. This would reflect as external checks disappearing and reappearing in SUSE Observability. Use this model when: The external monitoring system isn’t capable of collecting all checks in a determined time window. The best effort is just to send the external checks as they’re obtained. JSON payload: The Repeat States health payload accepts specific properties to specify the expiry configuration. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Transactional Increments model\" %} The TRANSACTIONAL_INCREMENTS consistency model is designed to be used on streaming systems where only incremental changes are communicated to SUSE Observability. As there is no repetition of data, data consistency is upheld by ensuring that at-least-once delivery is guaranteed across the entire pipeline. To detect whether any data is missing, SUSE Observability requires that both a checkpoint and the previous checkpoint are communicated together with the check_states. This model requires strict control across the whole pipeline to guarantee no data loss. Use this model when: The external monitoring system doesn’t have access to the total external checks state, but only works on an event based approach. JSON payload: The metadata repeat_interval and expire_interval aren’t relevant for the Transactional Increments health payload as there is no predefined periodicity on the data. {% endtab %} {% endtabs %} External monitoring systems send health data to the SUSE Observability Receiver in a health stream. Each health stream has at least one substream with health checks. The Health stream uniquely identifies the health synchronization and defines the boundaries within which the health check states should be processed together. Sub streams contain the health check data that are processed by SUSE Observability. When working with health data from a distributed external monitoring system, multiple sub streams can be configured, each containing health snapshots from a single location. The data in each substream is semi-independent, but contributes to the health check states of the complete health stream. If a single location is responsible for reporting the health check states of the health stream, you can omit the sub_stream_id from the health payload. SUSE Observability will assume that all the external health checks belong to a single, default substream. Health synchronization processes the ingested health data per substream. The repeat interval specified in the health payload is the commitment from the external monitoring system to send complete snapshots over and over to keep the data up to date on SUSE Observability. This is helpful for SUSE Observability to be able to inform the user how up to date the health synchronization is running. The expire interval can be used to configure sub streams in the health synchronization to delete data that isn’t sent by the external system anymore. This is helpful in case the source for a substream could be decommissioned and SUSE Observability would not hear from it again. Without an expire interval, the previously synchronized data would be left permanently hanging. The health check state is calculated by an external monitoring system and includes all information required to attach it to a topology element. In order to be able to materialize and attach it to a component it requires to attribute the health state to a particular monitor in this case an ExternalMonitor. Once attached to a topology element, the health check state contributes to the element’s own health state. An external monitor allows to attach the health states to components and to show a remediationHint on the SUSE Observability highlight pages. This resource needs to be created via the SUSE Observability CLI or as part of a stackpack. Here is an example of an externa monitor: { \"_type\": \"ExternalMonitor\", \"healthStreamUrn\": \"urn:health:kubernetes:external-health\", \"description\": \"Monitored by external tool.\", \"identifier\": \"urn:custom:external-monitor:heartbeat\", \"name\": \"External Monitor Heartbeat\", \"remediationHint\": \"\", \"tags\": [ \"heartbeat\" ] } Every ExternalMonitor payload has the following details: _type: SUSE Observability needs to know this is a monitor so, value always needs to be ExternalMonitor healthStreamUrn: This field needs to match the urn that is sent as part of the Health Payload. description: A description of the external monitor. identifier: An identifier of the form urn:custom:external-monitor:.... which uniquely identifies the external monitor when updating its configuration. name: The name of the external monitor remediationHint: A description of what the user can do when the monitor fails.

This page describes the different types of identifiers used for topology elements and how global scope identifiers are structured in SUSE Observability. Topology elements use two types of identifiers in SUSE Observability: Integration scope identifiers - used for identifying components and relations within an integration. Each component or relation has only one integration scope identifier. The identifier is arbitrary, but must be consistent within the scope of the integration itself. Global scope identifiers - used for merging components between integrations, for example ServiceNow and the SUSE Observability Agent. Each component can have multiple global scope identifiers, while relations don’t have any global identifiers. They’re assigned by SUSE Observability and formatted in accordance with the SUSE Observability global identifier convention. The code sample below shows a component with both types of identifiers. Integration scope identifier - this-host-unique-identifier Global scope identifier - urn:host:/this-host-fqdn {% code lineNumbers=\"true\" %} self.component(\"this-host-unique-identifier\", \"Host\", { \"name\": \"this-host\", \"domain\": \"Webshop\", \"layer\": \"Machines\", \"identifiers\": [\"urn:host:/this-host-fqdn\"], \"labels\": [\"host:this-host\", \"region:eu-west-1\"], \"environment\": \"Production\" }) {% endcode %} The global scope identifiers used by the SUSE Observability Agent to identify synchronized topology elements are listed in the table below.

When SUSE Observability receives components with matching global scope identifiers from different external sources, the components and their properties (labels, streams, checks) are merged into a single component. This makes it possible to combine data from different sources into a single picture of an IT landscape. Global scope identifiers in SUSE Observability are a globally unique URN that matches the following convention: urn::: Note that not all characters are allowed in a URN identifier. You can check your identifiers with the following URN regex: ^urn:[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,31}:[a-z0-9()+,\\-.:=@;$_!*'%/?#]+$ The format of the and : segments are described below. The prefix segment is a required part of a global identifier. It names the scope that the identifier belongs to and is used purely for organizational purposes. When the prefix includes a StackPack name, the object will be under the control of that StackPack. This means that the object will be uninstalled when the StackPack is uninstalled. Recognized URN prefixes are: stackpack: - objects belonging to StackPacks. stackpack::shared - objects shared between instances of a StackPack. stackpack::instance:{{instanceId}}- objects belonging to a specific instance of a StackPack, where {{instanceId}} is a handlebar that returns the ID provided during the StackPack installation process for each specific instance of the StackPack. system:auto - objects created by the system that don’t belong to any specific StackPacks. The identifier is uniquely identified by the : segments. matches the domain object type of the object that the identifier is assigned to (not case-sensitive). is arbitrary, but must be unique for the type. The format of the free-form segment is decided by the user. It doesn’t need to match the name of the object (if any is present) and can itself consist of multiple segments. Example URN global scope identifiers from the common StackPack. The objects will be uninstalled when the common StackPack is uninstalled.

page describes how to use the built-in SUSE Observability Query Language (STQL) to write advanced topology component filters. STQL queries are used in SUSE Observability to write advanced topology filters. An STQL query consists of component filters and functions. The query output is a component, or set of components, filtered from the complete topology. Component filters are used in two ways in STQL: Define the set of components to be included in the query output. Specify the set of components to be handled by an in-built STQL function. The filters described below can be combined using the available operators to achieve complex selections of components. Filter Default Description healthstate \"all\" Components with the named health state. label \"all\" Components with the named labels. name \"all\" Components with the specified name. type \"all\" Components of the specified type. identifier \"all\" Components with the specified URN identifier. The identifier filter is only compatible with basic filtering when it’s specified using identifier IN (...) and combined with other filters using an OR operator. When the set filter is compatible with basic filtering, the number of component identifiers queried will be reported in the Other filters box. layer \"all\" Components in the named layer. domain \"all\" Components in the specified domain(s). environment \"all\" Components in the named environment. The operators described below are available to use in STQL queries. Note that boolean operators will be executed in the standard order: NOT, OR, AND. Operator Description Example = Equality matching name = \"cert-manager\" != Inequality matching name != \"coredns\" IN Value is in subset name in (\"cert-manager\", \"cluster_autoscaler\") NOT Negation name NOT in (\"cert-manager\", \"cluster_autoscaler\") AND and OR Filter based on more than one condition or sub-query name = \"cert-manager\" OR type = \"deployment\" () Use parenthesis to group results (name = … AND type = …) OR (…) For example: # Return all components named cert-manager or coredns regardless of type: name = \"cert-manager\" OR name = \"coredns\" # Return only deployments named coredns and configmaps named kube-root-ca.crt: (name = \"coredns\" AND type = \"deployment\") OR (name = \"kube-root-ca.crt\" AND type = \"configmap\") You can use * as a full wildcard in a component filter. It isn’t possible to filter for partial matches using a wildcard character. # Select all components name = \"*\" # Select all components with name \"etcd-manager\" name = \"etcd-manager\" # Select all components in the \"Containers\" layer: layer = \"Containers\" # Select all components named either \"etcd-manager\" or \"coredns\" that don't have a label \"cluster-name:prod.stackstate.io\" name IN (\"etcd-manager\",\"coredns\") NOT label = \"cluster-name:prod.stackstate.io\" # Select all components named \"coredns\" that don't have a label \"bck\" or \"test\" name = \"cert-manager\" NOT label in (\"image_name:cert-manager/cert-manager-controller:testA\", \"image_name:cert-manager/cert-manager-controller:testB\") The function withNeighborsOf extends STQL query output, adding connected components in the specified direction(s). The number of topology levels included can be adjusted up to a maximum of 15. withNeighborsOf(components=(), levels=, direction=) To be compatible with basic filtering, the function can only be combined with other filters using an OR operator. When an advanced filter includes a function withNeighborsOf that’s compatible with basic filtering, the number of components whose neighbors are queried for is shown in the Other filters box. Parameter Default Allowed values Description components \"all\" A component filter The component(s) for which the neighbors will be returned, see component filters. levels 1 \"all\", [1:14] The number of levels to include in the output. Use \"all\" to display all available levels (maximum 15) direction \"both\" \"up\", \"down\", \"both\" up: only components that depend on the named component(s) will be added down: only dependencies of the named component(s) will be added both: components that depend on and dependencies of the named component(s) will be added. The example below will return all components in the application layer that have a health state of either DEVIATING or CRITICAL. Components with names \"appA\" or \"appB\" and their neighbors will also be included. layer = \"Containers\" AND (healthstate = \"CRITICAL\" OR healthstate = \"DEVIATING\") OR withNeighborsOf(components = (name in (\"cert-manager\",\"coredns\"))) You can switch from basic to advanced filtering by selecting Advanced under Filter Topology in the View Filters panel. It’s always possible to switch from basic to advanced filtering. The selected basic filters will be converted directly to an STQL query. You can switch from advanced to basic filtering by selecting Basic under Filter Topology in the View Filters panel. It isn’t always possible to switch from advanced filtering to basic filtering. Mpst simple queries can be converted to basic filters, however, some advanced queries aren’t compatible with basic filters. Basic filters can’t contain an inequality. Basic filters don’t use =, they’re always formatted using the IN operator. For example name IN (\"cert-manager”) and not name = \"cert-manager”. Basic filters use AND/OR in a specific way: All items in each basic filter box are joined with an OR: layer IN (\"Containers\", \"Services\", \"Storage\") The different basic filter boxes are chained together with an AND: layer IN (\"Containers\") AND domain IN (\"cluster.test.stackstate.io”) The Include components basic filter box (name) is the exception - this is chained to the other filter boxes with an OR: layer IN (\"Containers\") AND domain IN (\"cluster.test.stackstate.io\") OR name IN (\"cert-manager”) To be compatible with basic filtering, the withNeighborsOf function and identifier filter must be joined to other filters with an OR: layer in (\"Containers\") OR identifier IN (\"urn:kubernetes:/cluster.test.stackstate.io:kube-system:pod/cert-manager-7749f44bb4-vspjj:container/cert-manager\") If you try to switch from an advanced filter to a basic filter and the query isn’t compatible, SUSE Observability will ask for confirmation before removing the incompatible filters. To keep the filters, you can choose to stay in advanced filtering.

Observing these connections is done through request tracing. Traced requests will result in connections in the topology perspective, to give insight in the dependencies across an application and help with finding the root cause of an incident. Request tracing is done by injecting a unique header (the X-Request-ID header) into all HTTP traffic. This unique header is observed at both client and server through an eBPF probe installed with the SUSE Observability Agent. These observations are sent to SUSE Observability, which uses the observations to understand which clients and server are connected. The X-Request-Id headers are injected by a sidecar proxy that can be automatically injected by the SUSE Observability Agent. The sidecar gets injected by a mutating webhook, which injects the sidecar into every pod for which the http-header-injector.stackstate.io/inject: enabled annotation is defined. Sidecar injection is not supported on OpenShift. It’s also possible to add the X-Request-Id header if your application already has a proxy or LoadBalancer, is deployed to an Istio service mesh enabled Kubernetes cluster or through instrumenting your own code. Advantage of this is that the extra sidecar proxy isn’t needed. Enabling trace header injection is a two-step process: Install the mutating webhook into the cluster by adding --set httpHeaderInjectorWebhook.enabled=true to the helm upgrade invocation when installing the SUSE Observability agent. By default the sidecar injector generates its own self-signed certificate, requiring cluster roles to install these into the cluster. It is also possible to manage your own certificates in a more restricted environment. For every pod that has a endpoint which processes http(s) requests, place the annotation http-header-injector.stackstate.io/inject: enabled to have the sidecar injected. Enabling the mutating webhook will only take effect upon pod restart If the annotation is placed before the webhook is installed. Installing the webhook has no effect until the pods get restarted. Disabling the trace header injection can be done with the reverse process: Remove the http-header-injector.stackstate.io/inject: enabled annotation from all pods. Redeploy the SUSE Observability Agent without the --set httpHeaderInjectorWebhook.enabled=true setting. Disabling the mutating webhook will only take effect upon pod restart If step 1 is skipped and only the mutating webhook is disabled, all pods need a restart for the sidecar to be removed. Request tracing adds a small, fixed amount of CPU overhead for each HTTP request header that gets injected and observed. The exact amount is dependent on the system that it’s ran on, so it’s advised to enable this feature first in an acceptance environment to observe the impact before moving to production. The sidecar proxy takes a minimum of 25Mb of memory per pod it’s deployed with, up to a maximum of 40Mb. To add the X-Request-Id header from an existing proxy, two properties are important: Each request/response pair has to get a unique ID. The X-Request-Id header should be added to both request and response, to be observed on both client and server. In envoy, the X-Request-Id header can be enabled by setting generate_request_id: true and always_set_request_id_in_response: true for http connections An Envoy Filter can be used to set the trace header for Envoy. Use kubectl to apply the following definition to the Kubernetes cluster, apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3 kind: EnvoyFilter metadata: name: responsed-x-request-id-always namespace: istio-system spec: configPatches: - applyTo: NETWORK_FILTER match: context: ANY listener: filterChain: filter: name: envoy.filters.network.http_connection_manager patch: operation: MERGE value: typed_config: '@type': >- type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager always_set_request_id_in_response: true generate_request_id: true preserve_external_request_id: true priority: 0 It’s also possible to add the X-Request-Id header form either the client side to each request, or on the server side to each response. It’s important to ensure each request/response gets a unique X-Request-Id value. Also, the X-Request-Id requires that if an ID is already present in a request, the response should contain that same ID.

You can now run CLI commands by adding appending them to the end of the docker run command (for example, docker run stackstate/stackstate-cli2 version). The most secure way to use your API token is through an environment variable. You can store the API token with a secrets manager and inject it as an environment variable into your shell. In the SUSE Observability UI, go to Main menu > CLI and copy your API token. Run the command below, where is the URL to your SUSE Observability instance and is the API token you copied from the CLI page in the SUSE Observability UI: sts context save --name --url --api-token The connection to your SUSE Observability instance will be tested and a configuration file stored at ~/.config/stackstate-cli/config.yaml. The Docker version of the CLI can’t be configured with a config file. Specify the configuration of your SUSE Observability instance using environment variables and pass these to Docker: STS_CLI_URL - the URL to your SUSE Observability instance. STS_CLI_API_TOKEN - the API token taken from the SUSE Observability UI Main menu > CLI page. For example: docker run \\ -e STS_CLI_URL \\ -e STS_CLI_API_TOKEN \\ stackstate/stackstate-cli2 settings list --type Layer By default, the CLI will authenticate using the API token that you provided when the CLI configuration was saved. You can optionally use the CLI to create one or more service tokens to authenticate with the SUSE Observability Base and Admin APIs. For example, a service token can be used to authenticate in CI (Continuous Integration) scenarios where no real user is doing the operations on the SUSE Observability instance. To create a service token, run the command below: sts service-token create --name --roles [--expiration ] This will create a new service token and print it. The --expiration parameter is optional and can be used to set the expiration date of the service token. Once you have this, you can configure the CLI to use it: sts context save --name --service-token --url The sts CLI supports configuration and management of different (authentication) contexts. This enables you to easily switch between an administrative and regular user, or to switch between different SUSE Observability instances. For example, you could use a different context for a test and production instance of SUSE Observability. You can list, save, delete, set and validate contexts in the sts CLI. Run sts context -h for details of the available commands and their usage. You don’t need a configuration file to run the sts CLI. You can also configure the CLI through a combination of environment variables and flags. If multiple types of configuration are presented to the CLI the order of processing will be: Flags Environment variables Config file Environment variable Flag Description STS_CLI_URL --url URL to your SUSE Observability instance. STS_CLI_API_TOKEN --api-token API token to your SUSE Observability instance. The most secure way to use your API token is through an environment variable. You can store the API token with a secrets manager and inject it as an environment variable into your shell. STS_CLI_SERVICE_TOKEN --service-token A service token to your SUSE Observability instance. The most secure way to use your service token is through an environment variable. You can store the service token with a secrets manager and inject it as an environment variable into your shell. STS_CLI_API_PATH n/a The path appended to the end of the URL to get the API endpoint. (Defaults to /api) STS_CLI_CONTEXT --context The name of the context to use. Next to overriding specific parts of the config file, it’s also possible to override the default config file location. This is done through the --config flag.

You can configure the data retention period to balance the amount of data stored with SUSE Observability performance and data availability. By default, topology graph data will be retained for 30 days. This works in a way that the latest state of topology graph will always be retained; only history older than 30 days will be removed. You can check and alter the configured retention period this using the SUSE Observability CLI. $ sts graph retention In some cases, it may be useful to keep historical data for more than 30 days or to reduce it to less than 30 days to save on disk space. $ sts graph retention --set 10d (note that the duration can be specified as a duration string) Note that by adding more time to the data retention period, the amount of data stored is also going to grow and need more storage space. This may also affect the performance of the Views. After changing the retention period to a smaller window, you may end up with some data that’s already expired and will wait there until the next scheduled cleanup. To schedule a cleanup soon after the new retention window is applied use this command: $ sts graph retention --set 10d --schedule-removal In some cases, for example a disk running full, it can be needed to force removal of data immediately. This will have an impact on performance and current activity on SUSE Observability so is better avoided. Note that this may take some time to have an effect. $ sts graph delete-expired-data --immediately If you are using the event/logs store provided with SUSE Observability, your data will by default be retained for 30 days. In most cases, the default settings will be sufficient to store all indices for this amount of time. In some circumstances it may be necessary to adjust the disk space available to Elasticsearch and how it’s allocated to logs, events and traces, for example if you anticipate a lot of data to arrive for a specific data type. Here is a snippet with the complete disk space and retention config for Elasticsearch, including the default values. elasticsearch: volumeClaimTemplate: resources: requests: storage: 250Gi stackstate: components: receiver: esDiskSpaceShare: 70 # Number of days to keep the logs data on Es retention: 7 e2es: esDiskSpaceShare: 30 # Number of days to keep the events data on Es retention: 30 trace2es: esDiskSpaceShare: 0 # Number of days to keep the traces data on Es retention: 7 enabled: false The disk space available for Elasticsearch is configured via the elasticsearch.volumeClaimTemplate.resources.requests.storage key. To change this value after the initial installation some extra steps are required. this is the disk space for each instance of ElasticSearch. For non-HA this is the total available disk space, but for HA there are 3 instances and a replication factor of 1. The end result is that the total available Elasticsearch storage will be (250Gi * 3) / 2 = 375Gi. Based on the esDiskSpaceShare and retention a portion of the Elasticsearch disk space is reserved for each data type. SUSE Observability uses VictoriaMetrics to store metrics. It’s configured with a default retention of 30 days. The helm chart allocates disk space and configures the retention period for the 1 or 2 Victoria metrics instances like this: victoria-metrics-0: server: persistentVolume: size: 250Gi retentionPeriod: 1 # month # For HA setups: victoria-metrics-1: server: persistentVolume: size: 250Gi retentionPeriod: 1 # month To change the volume size after the initial installation some extra steps are required. To change the retention period override both retentionPeriod keys with the same value in your custom values.yaml and update SUSE Observability: The following optional suffixes are supported: h (hour), d (day), w (week), y (year). If no suffix is set the duration is in months. Minimum retention period is 24h or 1 day. After making changes to the values.yaml SUSE Observability needs to be updated to apply those changes to the runtime. This may cause some short downtime while the services restart. To update SUSE Observability use the same command that was used during installation of SUSE Observability and make sure to include the same configuration files including the changes that have been made: Kubernetes OpenShift: In most clusters it’s possible to resize a persistent volume after it has been created and without interrupting the operation of applications at all. However this can’t be done by simply changing the configured storage size in the values.yaml of the SUSE Observability Helm chart. Instead several steps are needed: Verify the used storage class can be resized Resize the volumes Update values.yaml and apply change (optional but recommended) The examples below use the VictoriaMetrics storage as an example. SUSE Observability is installed in the stackstate namespace. The volume is going to be resized to 500Gi. Use the following kubectl commands to get the storage class used and check that the allowVolumeExpansion is set to true. # Get the PVC's for SUSE Observability kubectl get pvc --namespace stackstate # There is a storage class column in the output, copy it and use it to describe the storage class kubectl describe storageclass Verify that the output contains this line: AllowVolumeExpansion: True If the line is absent or if it’s set to False please consult with your Kubernetes administrator if resizing is supported and can be enabled. The SUSE Observability Helm chart creates a stateful set, which has a template to create the persistent volume claim (PVC). This template is only used to create the PVC once, after that it won’t be applied anymore and it’s also not allowed to change it. So to make the PVC’s bigger the PVC itself needs to be edited. To change the PVC size use the following commands. # Get the PVC's for SUSE Observability, allows us to check the current size and copy the name of the PVC to modify it with the next command kubectl get pvc --namespace stackstate # Patch the PVC's specified size, change it to 500Gi kubectl patch pvc server-volume-stackstate-victoria-metrics-0-0 -p '{\"spec\":{\"resources\": { \"requests\": { \"storage\": \"500Gi\" }}}}' # Get the PVC's again to verify if it was resized, depending on the provider this can take a while kubectl get pvc --namespace stackstate The change made to the persistent volume claim (PVC) will remain for the lifetime of the PVC, but whenever a clean install is done it will be lost. More importantly however, after resizing the PVC there is now a discrepancy between the cluster state and the definition of the desired state in the values.yaml. Therefore it’s recommended to update the values.yaml as well. To circumvent the fact that this change is not allowed, first remove the stateful set (but keep the pods running) to re-create it with the new settings. This step doesn’t change the size of the PVC itself, so only doing this step will result in no changes at all to the running environment. First edit your values.yaml to update the volume size for the PVC’s you’ve just resized. See the sections on Metrics or Events and Logs. Now remove the stateful set for the application(s) for which the storage has been changed: # List all stateful sets, check that all are ready, if not please troubleshoot that first kubectl get statefulset --namespace stackstate # Delete the kubectl delete statefulset --namespace stackstate stackstate-victoria-metrics-0 --cascade=orphan Finally update SUSE Observability with the new settings.","title":"Data retention","component":"observability","version":"next","name":"data_retention","url":"/observability/next/en/setup/data-management/data_retention.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Retention of topology graph data","hash":"_retention_of_topology_graph_data","id":2},{"text":"Retention of events, traces and logs","hash":"_retention_of_events_traces_and_logs","id":3},{"text":"SUSE Observability data store","hash":"_suse_observability_data_store","id":4},{"text":"Configure disk space for Elasticsearch","hash":"_configure_disk_space_for_elasticsearch","id":5},{"text":"Retention of metrics","hash":"_retention_of_metrics","id":6},{"text":"Update SUSE Observability","hash":"_update_suse_observability","id":7},{"text":"Resizing storage","hash":"_resizing_storage","id":8},{"text":"Verify the storage class supports resizing","hash":"_verify_the_storage_class_supports_resizing","id":9},{"text":"Resize the volumes","hash":"_resize_the_volumes","id":10},{"text":"Update values.yaml and apply the change","hash":"_update_values_yaml_and_apply_the_change","id":11}]},"27":{"id":27,"text":"","title":"Installation","component":"observability","version":"next","name":"README","url":"/observability/next/en/setup/install-stackstate/README.html","titles":[]},"28":{"id":28,"text":"This page provides all the information you need to install and run SUSE Observability. {% tabs %} {% tab title=\"Kubernetes\" %} Install SUSE Observability on Kubernetes. {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"OpenShift\" %} Install SUSE Observability on OpenShift. {% endtab %} {% endtabs %} {% tabs %} {% tab title=\"Kubernetes\" %} To access the SUSE Observability UI: Enable a port-forward.

SUSE Observability can be installed on a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster using the Helm charts provided by SUSE Observability. These Helm charts require Helm v3.x to install and are supported on: Kubernetes: 1.21 to 1.30 OpenShift: 4.9 to 4.14 There are different installation options available for SUSE Observability. It is possible to install SUSE Observability either in a High-Availability (HA) or single instance (non-HA) setup. The non-HA setup is recommended for testing purposes only. For production environments, it is recommended to install SUSE Observability in a HA setup. For a standard, production, deployment, the SUSE Observability Helm chart will deploy many services in a redundant setup with 3 instances of each service. In the table below you can find the resource requirements for the different installation options. For the HA setup you can find different installation profiles depending on the size of the environment being observed. 10 non-HA 20 non-HA 50 non-HA 100 non-HA 150 HA 250 HA 500 HA CPU Requests 7,5 10,5 15 25 49 62 86.5 CPU Limits 16 21,5 30,5 50 103 128 176 Memory Requests 22Gi 28Gi 32.5Gi 51Gi 67Gi 143Gi 161.5Gi Memory Limits 23Gi 29Gi 33Gi 51,5Gi 131Gi 147.5Gi 166Gi These are just the upper and lower bounds of the resources that can be consumed by SUSE Observability in the different installation options. The actual resource usage will depend on the features used, configured resource limits and dynamic usage patterns, such as Deployment or DaemonSet scaling. For our Self-hosted customers, we recommend to start with the default requirements and monitor the resource usage of the SUSE Observability components. The minimum requirements do not include spare CPU/Memory capacity to ensure smooth application rolling updates. For installation of SUSE Observability please follow the installation instructions provided below: Kubernetes OpenShift SUSE Observability uses persistent volume claims for the services that need to store data. The default storage class for the cluster will be used for all services unless this is overridden by values specified on the command line or in a values.yaml file. All services come with a pre-configured volume size that should be good to get you started, but can be customized later using variables as required. For our different installation profiles, the following are the defaulted storage requirements: trial 10 non-HA 20 non-HA 50 non-HA 100 non-HA 150 HA 250 HA 500 HA Retention (days) 3 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 Storage requirement 125GB 280GB 420GB 420GB 600GB 2TB 2TB 2.5TB The storage estimates presented take into account a default of 14 days of retention for NONHA and 1 month for HA installations. For short lived test instances the storage sizes can be further reduced. For more details on the defaults used, see the page Configure storage. By default, the SUSE Observability Helm chart will deploy a router pod and service. This service’s port 8080 is the only entry point that needs to be exposed via Ingress. You can access SUSE Observability without configuring Ingress by forwarding this port: kubectl port-forward service/-stackstate-k8s-router 8080:8080 --namespace stackstate When configuring Ingress, make sure to allow for large request body sizes (50MB) that may be sent occasionally by data sources like the SUSE Observability Agent or the AWS integration. For more details on configuring Ingress, have a look at the page Configure Ingress docs. It isn’t recommended to set a ResourceQuota as this can interfere with resource requests. The resources required by SUSE Observability will vary according to the features used, configured resource limits and dynamic usage patterns, such as Deployment or DaemonSet scaling. If it’s necessary to set a ResourceQuota for your implementation, the namespace resource limit should be set to match the node sizing requirements.

This can be delayed due to scheduling and docker image pulling delays. Pods that are in pending state are usually an indication of a problem: The pod is unschedulable due to lack of resources in the cluster. If a cluster auto-scaler is active it will often be able to resolve this automatically, otherwise manual intervention is needed to add more nodes to the cluster The pod is unschedulable, there are nodes it would fit on, but those nodes have taints that the pod doesn not tolerate. To solve this more nodes can be added that don’t have the taints, but SUSE Observability can also be configured to tolerate certain taints and run on the tainted nodes. The pod is waiting for the Persistent Volumes (PVs) to be mounted. A cause can be that the SUSE Observability Helm chart doesn’t specify a storageClassName but relies on the cluster having a default storage class. When there is no default for the cluster it’s required to specify a storage class via the Helm values of SUSE Observability. For pods with state ImagePullBackOff also check the exact error message, common causes are: An incorrect username/password used to pull the images Connecting to the docker registry failed, this can be due to authentication issues or connectivity issues (firewalls, air-gapped installations) A typo in the overriden docker image registry URL To find out a more detailed cause for the Pending, ImagePullBackOff or CrashLoopBackOff states use this command: + kubectl describe pod + The output contains an event section at the end which usually contains the problem.

Applications instrumented with Open Telemetry SDKs can use the collector to send telemetry data to SUSE Observability (traces and metrics). Your applications, when set up with OpenTelemetry SDKs, can use the collector to send telemetry data, like traces and metrics, straight to SUSE Observability. The collector is set up to receive this data by default via OTLP, the native open telemetry protocol. It can also receive data in other formats provided by other instrumentation SDKs like Jaeger and Zipkin for traces, and Influx and Prometheus for metrics. Usually, the collector is running close to your application, like in the same Kubernetes cluster, making the process efficient. For SUSE Observability integration, it’s simple: SUSE Observability offers an OTLP endpoint using the gRPC protocol and uses bearer tokens for authentication. This means configuring your OpenTelemetry collector to send data to SUSE Observability is easy and standardized. A Kubernetes cluster with an application that is instrumented with Open Telemetry An API key for SUSE Observability Permissions to deploy the open telemetry collector in a namespace on the cluster (i.e. create resources like deployments and configmaps in a namespace). To be able to enrich the data with Kubernetes attributes permission is needed to create a cluster role and role binding. To install and configure the collector for usage with SUSE Observability we’ll use the Open Telemetry Collector helm chart and add the configuration needed for SUSE Observability: Configure the collector helm chart configuration generating metrics from traces sending the data to SUSE Observability combine it all together in pipelines Create a Kubernetes secret for the SUSE Observability API key Deploy the collector Configure your instrumented applicatins to send telemetry to the collector Here is the full values file needed, continue reading below the file for an explanation of the different parts. Or skip ahead to the next step, but make sure to replace: with the OTLP endpoint of your SUSE Observability. If, for example, you access SUSE Observability on play.stackstate.com the OTLP endpoint is otlp-play.stackstate.com. So simply prefixing otlp- to the normal SUSE Observability url will do. with the cluster name you configured in SUSE Observability. This must be the same cluster name used when installing the SUSE Observability agent. Using a differnt cluster name will result in an empty traces perspective for Kubernetes components. The Kubernetes attributes and the span metrics namespace are required for SUSE Observability to provide full functionality. The suggested configuration includes tail sampling for traces. Sampling can be fully customized and, depending on your applications and the volume of traces, it may be needed to change this configuration. For example an increase (or decrease) in max_total_spans_per_second. It is highly recommended to keep sampling enabled to keep resource usage and cost under control. {% code title=\"otel-collector.yaml\" lineNumbers=\"true\" %} extraEnvsFrom: - secretRef: name: open-telemetry-collector mode: deployment ports: metrics: enabled: true presets: kubernetesAttributes: enabled: true extractAllPodLabels: true config: extensions: bearertokenauth: scheme: SUSEObservability #Use `StackState` for the Chart older than 2.0.3 token: \"${env:API_KEY}\" exporters: otlp/stackstate: auth: authenticator: bearertokenauth endpoint: :443 processors: tail_sampling: decision_wait: 10s policies: - name: rate-limited-composite type: composite composite: max_total_spans_per_second: 500 policy_order: [errors, slow-traces, rest] composite_sub_policy: - name: errors type: status_code status_code: status_codes: [ ERROR ] - name: slow-traces type: latency latency: threshold_ms: 1000 - name: rest type: always_sample rate_allocation: - policy: errors percent: 33 - policy: slow-traces percent: 33 - policy: rest percent: 34 resource: attributes: - key: k8s.cluster.name action: upsert value: - key: service.instance.id from_attribute: k8s.pod.uid action: insert filter/dropMissingK8sAttributes: error_mode: ignore traces: span: - resource.attributes[\"k8s.node.name\"] == nil - resource.attributes[\"k8s.pod.uid\"] == nil - resource.attributes[\"k8s.namespace.name\"] == nil - resource.attributes[\"k8s.pod.name\"] == nil connectors: spanmetrics: metrics_expiration: 5m namespace: otel_span routing/traces: error_mode: ignore match_once: false table: - statement: route() pipelines: [traces/sampling, traces/spanmetrics] service: extensions: - health_check - bearertokenauth pipelines: traces: receivers: [otlp] processors: [filter/dropMissingK8sAttributes, memory_limiter, resource] exporters: [routing/traces] traces/spanmetrics: receivers: [routing/traces] processors: [] exporters: [spanmetrics] traces/sampling: receivers: [routing/traces] processors: [tail_sampling, batch] exporters: [debug, otlp/stackstate] metrics: receivers: [otlp, spanmetrics, prometheus] processors: [memory_limiter, resource, batch] exporters: [debug, otlp/stackstate] {% endcode %} The config section customizes the collector config itself and is discussed in the next section.

In its configuration, we can see it is getting the SUSE Observability API key from the environment variable API_KEY. The pipelines section defines pipelines for the traces and metrics. The metrics pipeline defines: receivers, to receive metrics from instrumented applications (via the OTLP protocol, otlp), from spans (the spanmetrics connector) and by scraping Prometheus endpoints (the prometheus receiver). The latter is configured by default in the collector Helm chart to scrape the collectors own metrics processors: The memory_limiter helps to prevent out-of-memory errors. The batch processor helps better compress the data and reduce the number of outgoing connections required to transmit the data. The resource processor adds additional resource attributes (discussed separately) exporters: The debug exporter simply logs to stdout which helps when troubleshooting. The otlp/stackstate exporter sends telemetry data to SUSE Observability using the OTLP protocol. It is configured to use the bearertokenauth extension for authentication to send data to the SUSE Observability OTLP endpoint. For traces, there are 3 pipelines that are connected: traces: The pipeline that receives traces from SDKs (via the otlp receiver) and does the initial processing using the same processors as for metrics. It exports into a router which routes all spans to both other traces pipelines. This setup makes it possible to calculate span metrics for all spans while applying sampling to the traces that are exported. traces/spanmetrics: Use the spanmetrics connector as an exporter to generate metrics from the spans (otel_span_duration and otel_span_calls). It is configured to not report time series anymore when no spans have been observed for 5 minutes. SUSE Observability expects the span metrics to be prefixed with otel_span_, which is taken care of by the namespace configuration. traces/sampling: The pipeline that exports traces to SUSE Observability using the OTLP protocol, but uses the tail sampling processor to make the trace volume that is sent to SUSE Observability predictable to keep the cost predictable as well. Sampling is discussed in a separate section. The resource processor is configured for both metrics and traces. It adds extra resource attributes: The k8s.cluster.name is added by providing the cluster name in the configuration. SUSE Observability needs the cluster name and Open Telemetry does not have a consistent way of determining it. Because some SDKs, in some environments, provide a cluster name that does not match what SUSE Observability expects the cluster name is an upsert (overwrites any pre-existing value). The service.instance.id is added based on the pod uid. It is recommended to always provide a service instance id, and the pod uid is an easy way to get a unique identifier if the SDKs don’t provide one. It is highly recommended to use sampling for traces: To manage resource usage by only processing and storing the most relevant traces To manage costs and have predictable costs To reduce noise and focus on the important traces only, for example by filtering out health checks There are 2 approaches for sampling, head sampling and tail sampling. This Open Telemetry docs page discusses the pros and cons of both approaches in detail. The collector configuration provided here uses tail sampling to support these requirements: Have predictable cost by having a predictable trace volume Have a large sample of all errors Have a large sample of all slow traces Have a sample of all other traces to see the normal application behavior Criteria 2 and 3 can only be fulfilled by tail sampling. Let’s look at the sampling policies used in the configuration of the tail sampler now: There is only one top-level policy, it is a composite policy. It uses a rate limit, allowing at most 500 traces per second, giving a predictable trace volume. It uses other policies as sub-policies to make the actual sampling decissions. The errors policy is of type status_code and is configured to only sample traces that contain errors. 33% of the rate limit is reserved for errors, via the rate_allocation section of the composite policy. The slow-traces policy is of type latency and filters all traces slower than 1 second. 33% of the rate limits is reserved for the slow traces. The rest policy is of the always_sample type. It will sample all traces until it hits the rate limit enforced by the composite policy, which is 34% of the total rate limit of 500 traces. There are many more policies available that can be added to the configuration when needed. For example, it is possible to filter traces based on certain attributes (only for a specific application or customer). The tail sampler can also be replaced with the probabilistic sampler. For all configuration options please use the documentation of these processors: Tail sampling Probabilistic sampling The collector needs a Kubernetes secret with the SUSE Observability API key. Create that in the same namespace (here we are using the open-telemetry namespace) where the collector will be installed (replace with your API key): kubectl create secret generic open-telemetry-collector \\ --namespace open-telemetry \\ --from-literal=API_KEY='' SUSE Observability supports two types of keys: Receiver API Key Ingestion API Key You can find the API key for SUSE Observability on the Kubernetes Stackpack installation screen: Open SUSE Observability Navigate to StackPacks and select the Kubernetes StackPack Open one of the installed instances Scroll down to the first set of installation instructions. It shows the API key as STACKSTATE_RECEIVER_API_KEY in text and as 'stackstate.apiKey' in the command. SUSE Observability supports creating multiple Ingestion Keys. This allows you to assign a unique key to each OpenTelemetry Collector for better security and access control. For instructions on generating an Ingestion API Key, refer to the documentation page. To deploy the collector first make sure you have the Open Telemetry helm charts repository configured: helm repo add open-telemetry https://open-telemetry.github.io/opentelemetry-helm-charts Now install the collector, using the configuration defined in the previous steps: helm upgrade --install opentelemetry-collector open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector \\ --values otel-collector.yaml \\ --namespace open-telemetry The collector as it is configured now is ready to receive and send telemetry data. The only thing left to do is to update the SDK configuration for your applications to send their telemetry via the collector to the agent. Use the generic configuration for the SDKs to export data to the collector. Follow the language-specific instrumentation instructions to enable the SDK for your applications. The Open Telemetry documentation provides much more details on the configuration and alternative installation options: Open Telemetry Collector configuration: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/ Kubernetes installation of the collector: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/kubernetes/helm/collector/ Using the Kubernetes operator instead of the collector Helm chart: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/kubernetes/operator/ Open Telemetry sampling: https://opentelemetry.io/blog/2022/tail-sampling/","title":"Open Telemetry Collector","component":"observability","version":"next","name":"collector","url":"/observability/next/en/setup/otel/collector.html","titles":[{"text":"Pre-requisites","hash":"_pre_requisites","id":1},{"text":"Kubernetes configuration and deployment","hash":"_kubernetes_configuration_and_deployment","id":2},{"text":"Configure the collector","hash":"_configure_the_collector","id":3},{"text":"Configuration","hash":"_configuration","id":4},{"text":"Trace Sampling","hash":"_trace_sampling","id":5},{"text":"Create a secret for the API key","hash":"_create_a_secret_for_the_api_key","id":6},{"text":"Receiver API Key","hash":"_receiver_api_key","id":7},{"text":"Ingestion API Key","hash":"_ingestion_api_key","id":8},{"text":"Deploy the collector","hash":"_deploy_the_collector","id":9},{"text":"Configure applications","hash":"_configure_applications","id":10},{"text":"Related resources","hash":"_related_resources","id":11}]},"32":{"id":32,"text":"SUSE Observability supports Open Telemetry. Open Telemetry is a set of standardized protocols and an open-source framework to collect, transform and ship telemetry data such as traces, metrics and logs. Open telemetry supports a wide variety of programming languages and platforms. SUSE Observability has support for both metrics and traces and adds the Open Telemetry metrics and traces to the (Kubernetes) topology data that is provided by the SUSE Observability agent. Therefore it is still needed to also install the SUSE Observability agent. Support for logs and using Open Telemetry without the SUSE Observability agent is coming soon. Open Telemetry consists of several different components. For usage with SUSE Observability, the SDKs to instrument your application and the Open Telemetry collector are the most important parts. We’ll show how to configure both for usage with SUSE Observability. If your application is already instrumented with Open Telemetry or with any other library that is supported by Open Telemetry, like Jaeger or Zipkin, the collector can be used to ship that data to SUSE Observability and no additional instrumentation is needed. SUSE Observability requires the collector to be configured with specific processors and authentication to make sure all data used by SUSE Observability is available.

To find out where the problem is the quickest approach is to pick a pod from which telemetry data is expected: Check the beginning of the logs for the pod, SDKs will log warnings or errors when instrumentation fails at startup Check the logs also for any errors related to sending data to the collector Check the logs of the collector pod(s) for configuration or initialization errors, these will be logged right after the startup of the pod Check the collector logs also for errors related to sending data to SUSE Observability The error(s) in the logs usually give a good indication of the problem. We list the most common causes for Open Telemetry data not being available for some or all of your instrumented applications. If the problem is not listed here you can also look at the language-specific SDK documentation or the collector documentation from Open Telemetry. Make sure you use the same Kubernetes cluster name for the same cluster when: Installing the Open Telemetry Collector Installing the SUSE Observability agent Installing the Kubernetes StackPack When different names are used for the same cluster SUSE Observability will not be able to match the data from Open Telemetry with the data from the SUSE Observability agent and the traces perspective will remain empty. If there are connection errors it is possible the OTLP endpoint is incorrect. If there are authentication/authorization errors (status codes 401 and 403) it is likely the API key is not valid (anymore). Check that the configured OTLP endpoint is the URL for your SUSE Observability, prefixed with otlp- and suffixed with :443. For example, the OTLP endpoint for play.stackstate.com is otlp-play.stackstate.com:443. To ensure the api key is configured correctly check that: the secret contains a valid API key (verify this in SUSE Observability) the secret is used as environment variables on the pod the bearertokenauth extension is using the correct scheme and the value from the API_KEY environment variable the bearertokenauth extension is used by the otlp/stackstate exporter If the collector needs to send data through a proxy or a firewall it can be that they either block the traffic completely or possibly drop some parts of the gRPC messages or unexpectedly drop the long-lived gRPC connection completely. The easiest fix is to switch from gRPC to use HTTP instead, by replacing the otlp/stackstate exporter configuration and all its references with the otlp-http/stackstate exporter with this configuration. otlp-http/stackstate: auth: authenticator: bearertokenauth endpoint: :4318 Here is similar to the , but instead of a otlp- prefix it has otlp-http- prefix, for example, otlp-http-play.stackstate.com. If the SDK logs errors about not being able to resolve the collector DNS name it may be the configured collector URL is incorrect. In Kubernetes, your application is usually deployed in a separate namespace from the collector. This means that the SDK needs to be configured with the fully qualified domain name for the collector service: http://..svc.cluster.local:4317. In the collector installation steps, this was http://opentelemetry-collector.open-telemetry.svc.cluster.local:4317, but if you used a different namespace or release name for the collector this may be different for your situation. If the SDK logs network connection timeouts it can be that either there is a misconfiguration on the collector or the wrong port is used. But it is also possible that Kubernetes network policies are blocking network traffic from your application to the collector. This is best verified with your Kubernetes administrator. Network policies should at least allow TCP traffic on the configured port (4317 and/or 4318) from all of your applications to the collector. Not all language SDKs have support for gRPC. If OTLP over gRPC is not supported it is best to switch to OTLP over HTTP. The SDK exporter config describes how to make this switch. Using the wrong port usually appears as a connection error but can also show up as network connections being unexpectedly closed. Make sure the SDK exporter is using the right port when sending data. See the SDK exporter config. If the collector needs to send data through a proxy or a firewall it can be that they either block the traffic completely or possibly drop some parts of the gRPC messages or unexpectedly drop the long-lived gRPC connection completely. The SDK exporter config describes how to switch from gRPC to HTTP instead. The Open Telemetry collector enriches the telemetry data with Kubernetes metadata. The way it is configured all telemetry data that cannot be enriched is dropped. However, the collector cannot enrich pods that are running with hostNetwork: true set automatically. This is not possible because pod identification happens using the IP address of the pod and pods that use the host network use the IP address of the host. To help the collector to identify a pod we can add the k8s.pod.uid attribute to the metadata by instructing the SDK to add it directly. To do this modify your pod spec and add the following environment variables to your instrumented application container: env: - name: POD_UID valueFrom: fieldRef: apiVersion: v1 fieldPath: metadata.uid - name: OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES value: k8s.pod.uid=$(POD_UID) If the OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES env var is already set simply add the k8s.pod.uid, using a comma as separator. The value is a comma-separated list. The Node.js SDK, only on GKE, expects that the Kubernetes namespace is set via the NAMESPACE environment variable. If it is not set it will still add the k8s.namespace.name attribute but with an empty value. This prevents the Kubernetes attributes processor from inserting the correct namespace name. Until this is fixed a workaround is to update your pod spec and add this environment variable to the instrumented container(s): env: - name: NAMESPACE valueFrom: fieldRef: apiVersion: v1 fieldPath: metadata.namespace The auto instrumentation for Node.js, configured via environment variables, only supports traces. At least until this Open Telemetry issue is resolved. To enable metrics from the automatic instrumentation code changes are needed. Please follow the instructions in the Open Telemetry documentation to make these changes. During the installation of the collector, a cluster role and cluster role binding are created in Kubernetes that allows the collector to read metadata from Kubernetes resources. If this fails or they get removed the collector will not be able to query the Kubernetes API anymore. This will appear as errors in the collector log, the errors include the resource types for which the metadata could not be retrieved. To fix this re-install the collector with the Helm chart and make sure you have the required permissions to create the cluster role and cluster role binding. Alternatively, ask your cluster administrator to do the collector installation with the required permissions.","title":"Troubleshooting Open Telemetry","component":"observability","version":"next","name":"troubleshooting","url":"/observability/next/en/setup/otel/troubleshooting.html","titles":[{"text":"Use the same Kubernetes cluster name","hash":"_use_the_same_kubernetes_cluster_name","id":1},{"text":"The collector cannot send data to SUSE Observability","hash":"_the_collector_cannot_send_data_to_suse_observability","id":2},{"text":"SUSE Observability’s OTLP endpoint and API key are misconfigured","hash":"_suse_observabilitys_otlp_endpoint_and_api_key_are_misconfigured","id":3},{"text":"Some proxies and firewalls don’t work well with gRPC","hash":"_some_proxies_and_firewalls_dont_work_well_with_grpc","id":4},{"text":"The instrumented application cannot send data to the collector","hash":"_the_instrumented_application_cannot_send_data_to_the_collector","id":5},{"text":"The URL is incorrect or traffic is blocked","hash":"_the_url_is_incorrect_or_traffic_is_blocked","id":6},{"text":"The language SDK doesn’t support gRPC","hash":"_the_language_sdk_doesnt_support_grpc","id":7},{"text":"The language SDK uses the wrong port","hash":"_the_language_sdk_uses_the_wrong_port","id":8},{"text":"Some proxies and firewalls don’t work well with gRPC","hash":"_some_proxies_and_firewalls_dont_work_well_with_grpc_2","id":9},{"text":"Kubernetes pods with hostNetwork enabled","hash":"_kubernetes_pods_with_hostnetwork_enabled","id":10},{"text":"Node.js application on Google Kubernetes Engine","hash":"_node_js_application_on_google_kubernetes_engine","id":11},{"text":"No metrics available for Node.js application","hash":"_no_metrics_available_for_node_js_application","id":12},{"text":"Kubernetes attributes cannot be added","hash":"_kubernetes_attributes_cannot_be_added","id":13}]},"34":{"id":34,"text":"This is the first release of SUSE Observability.

For example, event handlers can call out to webhooks in other systems. With the default configuration, SUSE Observability won’t be able to communicate with these systems if they’re secured with TLS using a self-signed certificate, or a certificate that isn’t by default trusted by the JVM. To mitigate this, SUSE Observability allows configuration of a custom trust store. You need to have the custom TLS certificate available. If you don’t have that, you will need to retrieve it via the browser. Use the keytool tool and the cacerts file included in the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) installation to convert an existing TLS certificate file to the format needed by SUSE Observability. You can run this on any machine, regardless of the type of operating system. If you don’t have the JVM installed on your computer, you can also use a JVM Docker image instead. With the JVM installed on your computer and the certificate saved as a file site.cert, you can create a new trust store by taking the JVM’s trust store and adding the extra certificate. Create a working directory workdir and copy the certificate file site.cert to this directory. Change directory to the workdir and make a copy of the cacerts file from your Java installation. $JAVA_HOME is an environment variable that contains the location of your Java installation. This is normally set when installing Java. cd workdir cp $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts ./custom_cacerts Run the following keytool command to add the certificate. The required password is changeit. The alias needs to be a unique alias for the certificate, for example the domain name itself without any dots. keytool -import -keystore custom_cacerts -alias -file site.cert The custom_cacerts store file will now include the site.cert certificate. You can verify that by searching for the alias in the output of keytool -list -keystore custom_cacerts If you don’t have JVM installed on your computer, you can use a JVM Docker image. The certificate should be retrieved and saved as a file site.cert. Create a working directory workdir and copy the certificate file site.cert to this directory. Start the Java Docker container with the workdir mounted as a volume so it can be accessed: docker run -it -v `pwd`/workdir:/workdir adoptopenjdk:11 bash Change directory to the workdir and make a copy of the cacerts file: cd /workdir cp $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts ./custom_cacerts Run the following keytool command to add the certificate.

At the end the SUSE Observability CLI will be used to create and update the monitor in SUSE Observability. nodes: - _type: Monitor arguments: metric: query: unit: aliasTemplate: comparator: threshold: failureState: urnTemplate: titleTemplate: description: function: {{ get \"urn:stackpack:common:monitor-function:threshold\" }} identifier: urn:custom:monitor:... intervalSeconds: 30 name: remediationHint: status: tags: {} The fields in this template are: _type: SUSE Observability needs to know this is a monitor so, value always needs to be Monitor query: A PromQL query. Use the metric explorer of your SUSE Observability instance, http://your-instance/#/metrics, and use it to construct query for the metric of interest. unit: The unit of the values in the time series returned by the query or queries, used to render the Y-axis of the chart. See the supported units reference for all units. aliasTemplate: An alias for time series in the metric chart. This is a template that can substitute labels from the time series using the ${my_label} placeholder. comparator: Choose one of LTE/LT/GTE/GT to compare the threshold against the metric. Time series for which holds true will produce the failure state. threshold: A numeric threshold to compare against. failureState: Either \"CRITICAL\" or \"DEVIATING\". \"CRITICAL\" will show as read in SUSE Observability and \"DEVIATING\" as orange, to denote different severity. urnTemplate: A template to construct the urn of the component a result of the monitor will be bound to. titleTemplate: A title for the result of a monitor. Because multiple monitor results can bind to the same component, it’s possible to substitute time series labels using the ${my_label} placeholder. description: A description of the monitor. function: A reference to the monitor function that will execute the monitor. Currently only {{ get \"urn:stackpack:kubernetes-v2:shared:monitor-function:threshold\" }} is supported. identifier: An identifier of the form urn:custom:monitor:.... which uniquely identifies the monitor when updating its configuration. intervalSeconds: The interval at which the monitor executes. For regular real-time metric 30 seconds is advised. For longer-running analytical metric queries a bigger interval is recommended. name: The name of the monitor remediationHint: A description of what the user can do when the monitor fails. The format is markdown, with optionally use of handlebars variables to customize the hint based on time series or other data (more explanation below). status: Either \"DISABLED\" or \"ENABLED\". Determines whether the monitor will run or not. tags: Add tags to the monitor to help organize them in the monitors overview of your SUSE Observability instance, http://your-SUSE Observability-instance/#/monitors For example, this could be the start for a monitor which monitors the available replicas of a deployment: nodes: - _type: Monitor arguments: metric: query: \"kubernetes_state_deployment_replicas_available\" unit: \"short\" aliasTemplate: \"Deployment replicas\" comparator: \"LTE\" threshold: 0.0 failureState: \"DEVIATING\" urnTemplate: description: \"Monitor whether a deployment has replicas. function: {{ get \"urn:stackpack:kubernetes-v2:shared:monitor-function:threshold\" }} identifier: urn:custom:monitor:deployment-has-replicas intervalSeconds: 30 name: Deployment has replicas remediationHint: status: \"ENABLED\" tags: - \"deployments\" The urnTemplate and remediationHint will be filled in the next steps. The results of a monitor need to be bound to components in SUSE Observability, to be visible and usable. The result of a monitor is bound to a component using the component identifiers. Each component in SUSE Observability has one or more identifiers that uniquely identify the component. To bind a result of a monitor to a component, it’s required to provide the urnTemplate. The urnTemplate substitutes the labels in the time series of the monitor result into the template, producing an identifier matching a component. This is best illustrated with the example: The metric that’s used in this example is the kubernetes_state_deployment_replicas_available metric. Run the metric in the metric explorer to observe what labels are available on the time series: In the above table it’s shown the metric has labels like cluster_name, namespace and deployment. Because the metric is observed on deployments, it’s most logical to bind the monitor results to deployment components. To do this, it’s required to understand how the identifiers for deployments are constructed: In the UI, navigate to the deployments view and select a single deployment. Open the Topology view, and click the deployment component. When expanding the Properties in the right panel of the screen, the identifiers will show after hovering as shown below: The identifier is shown as urn:kubernetes:/preprod-dev.preprod.stackstate.io:calico-system:deployment/calico-typha. This shows that the identifier is constructed based on the cluster name, namespace and deployment name. Knowing this, it’s now possible to construct the urnTemplate: ... urnTemplate: \"urn:kubernetes:/${cluster_name}:${namespace}:deployment/${deployment}\" ... To verify whether the urnTemplate is correct, is explained further below. The remediation hint is there to help users find the cause of an issue when a monitor fires. The remediation hint is written in markdown. It’s also possible to use the labels that are on the time series of the monitor result using a handlebars template, as in the following example: ... remediationHint: |- To remedy this issue with the deployment {{ labels.deployment }}, consider taking the following steps: 1. Look at the logs of the pods created by the deployment ... After completing the monitor.yaml, use the SUSE Observability CLI to create or update the monitor: sts monitor apply -f monitor.yaml Verify whether the monitor produces the expected results, using the steps below. The identifier is used as the unique key of a monitor. Changing the identifier will create a new monitor instead of updating the existing one. The sts monitor command has more options, for example it can list all monitors: sts monitor list To delete a monitor use sts monitor delete --id To edit a monitor, edit the original of the monitor that was applied, and apply again. Or there is a sts monitor edit command to edit the configured monitor in the SUSE Observability instance directly: sts monitor edit --id The in this command isn’t the identifier but the number in the Id column of the sts monitor list output. A monitor can be enabled or disabled. Enabled means the monitor will produce results, disabled means it will suppress all output. Use the following commands to enable/disable: sts monitor enable/disable --id It’s good practice to, after a monitor is made, validate whether it produces the expected result. The following steps can be taken: Go to the monitor overview page (http://your-SUSE Observability-instance/#/monitors) and find your monitor. Verify the Status column is in Enabled state. If the monitor is in Disabled state, enable it. If the status is in Error state, follow the steps below to debug. Verify you see the expected amount of states in the Clear/Deviating/Critical column. If the number of states is significantly lower or higher than the amount of components you meant to monitor, the PromQL query might be giving too many results. Observe whether the monitor is producing a result on one of the components that it’s meant to monitor for. If the monitor doesn’t show up, follow these steps to remedy. First check if the monitor is actually producing results. If this is the case but the monitor results do not show up on the components, there might be a problem with the binding. First use the following command to verify: sts monitor status --id If the output has Monitor health states with identifier which has no matching topology element (): ...., this shows that the urnTemplate may not generate an identifier matching the topology. To remedy this revisit your urnTemplate. Get the status of the monitor through the CLI sts monitor status --id The section Monitor Stream errors: will show the errors happening on the monitor and offer further help.","title":"Add a threshold monitor to components using the CLI","component":"observability","version":"next","name":"k8s-add-monitors-cli","url":"/observability/next/en/use/alerting/k8s-add-monitors-cli.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Steps","hash":"_steps","id":2},{"text":"Write the outline of the monitor","hash":"_write_the_outline_of_the_monitor","id":3},{"text":"Bind the results of the monitor to the correct components","hash":"_bind_the_results_of_the_monitor_to_the_correct_components","id":4},{"text":"Write the remediation hint","hash":"_write_the_remediation_hint","id":5},{"text":"Create or update the monitor in SUSE Observability","hash":"_create_or_update_the_monitor_in_suse_observability","id":6},{"text":"Enable or disable the monitor","hash":"_enable_or_disable_the_monitor","id":7},{"text":"Verifying the results of a monitor","hash":"_verifying_the_results_of_a_monitor","id":8},{"text":"Verify the execution of the monitor","hash":"_verify_the_execution_of_the_monitor","id":9},{"text":"Verify the binding of the monitor","hash":"_verify_the_binding_of_the_monitor","id":10},{"text":"Common issues","hash":"_common_issues","id":11},{"text":"The result of the monitor isn’t showing on a component","hash":"_the_result_of_the_monitor_isnt_showing_on_a_component","id":12},{"text":"The monitor is showing an error in the monitor status overview","hash":"_the_monitor_is_showing_an_error_in_the_monitor_status_overview","id":13}]},"44":{"id":44,"text":"SUSE Observability has the best practices encoded via monitors.

Follow the indications on this page to learn how to write an effective remediation guide yourself. Provide step by step instructions to guide a user into solving the issue detected by the monitor; Make sure the instructions are ordered by the most likely cause(s). If possible, include links to relevant data and/or resources to speed up the investigation. Keep it short and on point: Avoid over explaining - add links to supporting documentation if that’s the case; Avoid using a table of contents and similar content blocks; Avoid having a summary of the same content; Try to format the guide in a structured way. Use: bullet points numbering short sentences paragraphs inline formatted examples If there are open ends (there might be different causes which are still unknown), provide guidance for escalating the issue. E.g. provide the user with a support link/ number, etc. When a Kubernetes container has errors, it can enter into a state called CrashLoopBackOff, where Kubernetes attempts to restart the container to resolve the issue. The container will continue to restart until the problem is resolved.Take the following steps to diagnose the problem: ### Pod Events Check the pod events to identify any explicit errors or warnings. 1. Go to the \"Events\" section in the middle of the [Pod highlight page](/#/components/\\{{ componentUrnForUrl \\}}) 2. Check if there is are events like \"BackOff\", \"FailedScheduling\", \"FailedAttachVolume\" or \"OOMKilled\" in the Alert Category by clicking on 'Alerts'. 3. You can see the details of the event (click on the event) to give more information about the issue. 4. If the 'Show related event' option is enabled all events of resources related to this resource like a deployment will also show up and can give you a clue if any change on them is causing this issue. You can see this by checking if there is a correlation between the time of a deployment and a change of behaviour seen by the metrics and events of this pod. For easy correlation you can use 'shift'-'click' to add markers to the different graph, log and event widgets. ### Container Logs Check the container logs for any explicit errors or warnings Inspect the [Logs](/#/components/\\{{ componentUrnForUrl \\}}#logs) of all the containers in this pod. Search for hints in the logs by: 1. Looking for changes in logging pattern, by looking at the number of logs per time unit (The histogram bars). In many cases the change in pattern will indicate what is going on. You can click-drag on the histogram bars to narrow the logs displayed to that time-frame. 2. Searching for \"Error\" or \"Fatal\" in the search bar. 3. Looking at the logs around the time that the monitor triggered ### Recent Changes Look at the pod age in the \"About\" section on the [Pod highlight page](/#/components/\\{{ componentUrnForUrl \\}}) to identify any recent deployments that might have caused the issue 1. The \"Age\" is shown in the \"About\" section on the left side of the screen 2. If the \"Age\" and the time that the monitor was triggered are in close proximity then take a look at the most recent deployment by clicking on [Show last change](/#/components/\\{{ componentUrnForUrl \\}}#lastChange).

Monitors delivered with the product are added constantly. Have a look under the Monitors section in the main menu to find the full list. It is important to ensure that your services are available and accessible to users. To monitor this, SUSE Observability has set up a check that verifies if a service has at least one endpoint available. Endpoints are network addresses that enable communication between different components in a distributed system, and they need to be available for the service to function properly. If there is an occurrence of zero endpoints available within the last 10 minutes, the monitor will remain deviating, indicating that there may be an issue with the service that needs to be addressed. Allows Override Monitor arguments Users create resources (pods, services, etc.) in the namespace, and the quota system tracks usage to ensure it does not exceed hard resource limits for Cpu defined in a ResourceQuota. The monitor will alert when the total Cpu limits in the namespace gets to 90% or more of the established by the quota. Each resourcequota in the namespace produces a monitor health state.

The monitor will alert when the total Cpu requests in the namespace gets to 90% or more of the established by the quota. Each resourcequota in the namespace produces a monitor health state. It is important that the desired number of replicas for a Daemonset is being met. Daemonsets are used to manage a set of pods that need to run on all or a subset of nodes in a cluster, ensuring that a copy of the pod is running on each node that meets the specified criteria. This is useful for tasks such as logging, monitoring, and other cluster-level tasks that need to be executed on every node in the cluster. To monitor this, SUSE Observability has set up a check that verifies if the available replicas match the desired number of replicas. This check will only be applied to DaemonSets that have a desired number of replicas greater than zero. - If the number of available replicas is less than the desired number, the monitor will signal a DEVIATING health state, indicating that there may be an issue with the StatefulSet. - If the number of available replicas is zero, the monitor will signal a CRITICAL health state, indicating that the StatefulSet is not functioning at all. To understand the full monitor definition check the details. It is important that the desired number of replicas for a Deployments is being met. Deployments are used to manage the deployment and scaling of a set of identical Pods in a Kubernetes cluster.

HTTP responses with a status code in the 5xx range indicate server-side errors such as a misconfiguration, overload or internal server errors. To ensure a good user experience, the percentage of 5xx responses should be less than 5% of the total HTTP responses for a Kubernetes (K8s) service. It is important to keep an eye on the HTTP response times for a Kubernetes service. SUSE Observability monitors the 95th percentile response time, or Q95, which is a statistical measure indicating that 95% of the responses are faster than this time. This is a useful measure for identifying outliers and slow requests that may negatively impact the user experience. If the Q95 response time is above 3 seconds during a specified time window, the monitor will produce a notification indicating a deviating state. It is important to monitor the usage of Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) in your Kubernetes cluster. PVCs are used to store data that needs to persist beyond the lifetime of a container, and it’s crucial to ensure that they have enough space to store the data. To track this, SUSE Observability has set up a check that uses linear prediction to forecast the Kubernetes volume usage trend over a 12-hour period. If the trend indicates that the PVCs will run out of space within this time frame, you will receive a notification, allowing you to take action to prevent data loss or downtime.

Node disk pressure refers to a situation where the disks connected to a node experience excessive strain. While encountering node disk pressure is unlikely due to Kubernetes' built-in preventive measures, it can still occur sporadically. There are two primary reasons why node disk pressure may arise. The first reason relates to Kubernetes failing to clean up unused images. Under normal circumstances, Kubernetes regularly checks for and deletes any images that are not in use. Therefore, this is an uncommon cause of node disk pressure, but it should be acknowledged. The more probable issue involves the accumulation of logs. In Kubernetes, logs are typically saved in two scenarios: when containers are running and when the most recently exited container’s logs are retained for troubleshooting purposes. This approach aims to strike a balance between preserving important logs and discarding unnecessary ones over time. However, if a long-running container generates an extensive volume of logs, they may accumulate to the point where they overload the node disk’s capacity. To understand the full monitor definition check the details. Allows Override Monitor arguments Node memory pressure refers to a situation where the memory resources on a Kubernetes node are excessively strained. While encountering node memory pressure is uncommon due to Kubernetes' built-in resource management mechanisms, it can still occur under specific circumstances. There are two primary reasons why node memory pressure may arise. The first reason is related to misconfigured or insufficient resource requests and limits for containers running on the node. Kubernetes relies on resource requests and limits to allocate and manage resources effectively. If containers are not accurately configured with their memory requirements, they may consume more memory than expected, leading to node memory pressure. The second reason involves the presence of memory-intensive applications or processes. Certain workloads or applications may have higher memory demands, resulting in increased memory utilization on the node. If multiple pods or containers with substantial memory requirements are scheduled on the same node without proper resource allocation, it can cause memory pressure. To mitigate node memory pressure, it is crucial to review and adjust resource requests and limits for containers, ensuring they align with the actual memory needs of the applications. Monitoring and optimizing memory usage within the applications themselves can also help reduce memory consumption. Additionally, consider horizontal pod autoscaling to dynamically scale the number of pods based on memory utilization. Regular monitoring, analysis of memory-related metrics, and proactive allocation of memory resources can help maintain a healthy memory state on Kubernetes nodes. It’s essential to understand the specific requirements of your workloads and adjust resource allocation accordingly to prevent memory pressure and ensure optimal performance. Allows Override Monitor arguments Node PID pressure occurs when the available process identification (PID) resources on a Kubernetes node are excessively strained. The first reason is related to misconfigured or insufficient resource requests and limits for containers running on the node. Kubernetes relies on accurate resource requests and limits to effectively allocate and manage resources. If containers are not configured correctly with their PID requirements, they may consume more PIDs than expected, resulting in node PID pressure. The second reason is the presence of PID-intensive applications or processes. Some workloads or applications have higher demands for process identification, leading to increased PID utilization on the node. If multiple pods or containers with significant PID requirements are scheduled on the same node without proper resource allocation, it can cause PID pressure. To address node PID pressure, it is important to review and adjust resource requests and limits for containers to ensure they align with the actual PID needs of the applications. Monitoring and optimizing PID usage within the applications themselves can also help reduce PID consumption. Additionally, considering horizontal pod autoscaling can dynamically scale the number of pods based on PID utilization. Regular monitoring, analysis of PID-related metrics, and proactive allocation of PID resources are crucial for maintaining a healthy state of PID usage on Kubernetes nodes. It is essential to understand the specific requirements of your workloads and adjust resource allocation accordingly to prevent PID pressure and ensure optimal performance. Allows Override Monitor arguments Check if the Node is up and running as expected. Allows Override Monitor arguments It is important to ensure that the containers running in your Kubernetes cluster have enough memory to function properly. Out-of-memory (OOM) conditions can cause containers to crash or become unresponsive, leading to restarts and potential data loss. To monitor for these conditions, SUSE Observability set up a check that detects and reports OOM events in the containers running in the cluster. This check will help you identify any containers that are running out of memory and allow you to take action to prevent issues before they occur. Allows Override Monitor arguments Checks if a Pod that has been scheduled is running and ready to receive traffic within the expected amount of time. Monitors the duration of the server and consumer spans. When the 95th percentile of the duration is greater than the threshold (default 5000ms) the monitor has a Deviating state. This monitor supports overriding settings via monitor argument overrides. Monitors the percentage of the server and consumer spans that have an error status. If the percentage of error spans exceeds the threshold (default 5) the monitor has a Deviating state. This monitor supports overriding settings via monitor argument overrides. If a pod is within a waiting state and contains a reason of CreateContainerConfigError, CreateContainerError, CrashLoopBackOff, or ImagePullBackOff it will be seen as deviating. It is important to ensure that the desired number of replicas for your ReplicaSet (and Deployment) is being met. ReplicaSets and Deployments are used to manage the number of replicas of a particular pod in a Kubernetes cluster. To monitor this, SUSE Observability has set up a check that verifies if the available replicas match the desired number of replicas. This check will only be applied to ReplicaSets and Deployments that have a desired number of replicas greater than zero. If the number of available replicas is less than the desired number, the monitor will signal a DEVIATING health state, indicating that there may be an issue with the ReplicaSet or Deployment. If the number of available replicas is zero, the monitor will signal a CRITICAL health state, indicating that the ReplicaSet or Deployment is not functioning at all. Additionally, the health state of the ReplicaSet will propagate to the Deployment for more comprehensive monitoring. It is important to monitor the restarts for each container in a Kubernetes cluster. Containers can restart for a variety of reasons, including issues with the application or the infrastructure. To ensure that the application is running smoothly, SUSE Observability has set up a monitor that tracks the number of container restarts over a 10-minute period. If there are more than 3 restarts during this time frame, the container’s health state will be set to DEVIATING, indicating that there may be an issue that needs to be investigated. Monitors the duration of the server and consumer spans. When the 95th percentile of the duration is greater than the threshold (default 5000ms) the monitor has a Deviating state. This monitor supports overriding settings via monitor argument overrides. Percentage of server and consumer spans that are in an error state for a Kubernetes service. This monitor supports overriding settings via monitor argument overrides. It is important that the desired number of replicas for a StatefulSet is being met. StatefulSets are used to manage stateful applications and require a specific number of replicas to function properly. To monitor this, SUSE Observability has set up a check that verifies if the available replicas match the desired number of replicas. This check will only be applied to StatefulSets that have a desired number of replicas greater than zero. If the number of available replicas is less than the desired number, the monitor will signal a DEVIATING health state, indicating that there may be an issue with the StatefulSet. If the number of available replicas is zero, the monitor will signal a CRITICAL health state, indicating that the StatefulSet is not functioning at all. If you encounter a \"NodeNotSchedulable\" event in Kubernetes, it means that the Kubernetes scheduler was unable to place a pod on a specific node due to some constraints or issues with the node. This event occurs when the scheduler cannot find a suitable node to run the pod according to its resource requirements and other constraints. Cluster doesn’t have any health itself. But a cluster is build from few components, some of them are critical to normal operation. The monitor aggregates states of these components: all pods in 'kube-system' namespace all nodes and then takes the most critical health state. The monitor aggregates states of all children Pods and then returns the most critical health state. The monitor aggregates states of all children ReplicaSets and then returns the most critical health state.

This can be done by drilling down to pod level through any of the provided paradigms (Services, Deployments, Stateful Sets, Daemon Sets, etc.) from the Kubernetes menu on the left For simplicity, and completeness, the example uses the Pods paradigm directly, and a pod was chosen that contains multiple containers, as to be able to distinguish between Pod logs and Container logs. The Pod view will have multiple log-related entry points. To view all the logs associated with this Pod, click on either of the two options circled in red. To filter by log entry type (Errors, Warnings, Other), select one of the items circled in blue. The histogram displaying proportionality between the log entry types is circled in green. The Logs Drawer facilitates a visually pleasing experience to navigating log files in a way that enhances the troubleshooting experience. For simplicity, the example only deals with unfiltered selections (circled in red), which will display all log lines, of all containers, of any log entry type. Selecting either of the two options circled in red opens up the log drawer with no filtering applied: From this point onward, one could start to drill in closer to the problem by applying options to the provided filters (search string match, severity, container, log window interval). Several options are available for sorting and display preference directly below the histogram in the logs drawer. Search String Match will take an input search term and filter out any log line that does not contain it. Severity options are Any, Error, Warning, and Other. Selecting anything but Any will exclude all log lines that don’t match the selection. Container options will include Any, and a list of containers in the Pod. Selecting anything but Any will restrict output to that produced by the selected container. Log Window Interval options will be a date-time picker interface that allows you to specify a from and to interval. Changing this from the default will exclude all log entries that fall outside the selected period.

Extra metric charts can be added to any set of components whenever needed. When adding metrics to components there are 2 options: The metrics are already collected by SUSE Observability but aren’t visualized on a component by default The metrics aren’t yet collected by SUSE Observability at all and therefore aren’t available yet For option 1 the steps below will instruct you how to create a metric binding which will configure SUSE Observability to add a specific metric to a specific set of components. In case of option 2, first make sure that the metrics are available in SUSE Observability, by sending them to SUSE Observability using the Prometheus remote write protocol. Only after that continue by adding charts for the metrics to the components. Steps to create a metric binding: Write the outline of the metric binding Write the topology query (STQL) to select the components Write the PromQL query for the desired metric Bind the correct time series to each component Create or update the metric binding in SUSE Observability As an example the steps will add a metric binding for the Replica counts of Kubernetes deployments. This is just an example, this metric binding already exists in SUSE Observability by default. Create a new YAML file called metric-bindings.yaml and add this YAML template to it to create your own metric binding. Open it in your favorite code editor to change it throughout this guide. At the end the SUSE Observability CLI will be used to create and update the metric bindings in SUSE Observability. nodes: - _type: MetricBinding chartType: line enabled: true tags: {} unit: name: description: priority: identifier: urn:custom:metric-binding:... queries: - expression: alias: scope: layout: weight: layouts: - pespective: Metrics tab: name: weight: section: name: weight: The fields in this template are: _type: SUSE Observability needs to know this is a metric binding so, value always needs to be MetricBinding chartType: SUSE Observability will support different chart types (line, bar, etc.), currently only line is supported enabled: Set to false to keep the metric binding but not show it to users tags: Will be used to organize metrics in the user interface, can be left empty using {} unit: The unit of the values in the time series returned by the query or queries, used to render the Y-axis of the chart. See the supported units reference for all units. name: The name for the metric binding description: Optional description, displayed on-hover of the name priority: [Deprecated] One of HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW. Main sort order for metrics on a component (in the order they’re mentioned here), secondary sort order is the name. identifier: A URN (universal resource identifier), used as the unique identifier of the metric binding. It must start with urn:custom:metric-binding:, the remainder is free-format as long as it’s unique amongst all metric bindings. queries: A list of queries to show in the chart for the metric binding (see also the following sections) scope: The topology scope of the metric binding, a topology query that selects the components on which this metric binding will be shown. layout: How to groups charts on different perspective views, e.g. on Metrics perspective Fill in all the parts already known first (with the deployment replica counts as the example) _type: MetricBinding chartType: line enabled: true tags: {} unit: short name: Replica counts priority: MEDIUM identifier: urn:custom:metric-binding:my-deployment-replica-counts queries: - expression: alias: scope: The queries and scope section will be filled in the next steps. Note that the unit used is short, which will simply render a numeric value. In case you’re not sure yet about the unit of the metric, you can leave it open and decide on the correct unit when writing the PromQL query. Use the Explore view of the Topology perspective, http://your-instance/#/views/explore, and select the components that need to show the new metric. Both the basic and advanced views can be used to make the selection. The most common fields to select topology on for metric bindings are type for the component type and label for selecting all the labels. For example for the deployments: type = \"deployment\" and label = \"stackpack:kubernetes\" The type filter selects all deployments, while the label filter selects only components created by the Kubernetes stackpack (label name is stackpack and label value is kubernetes). The latter can also be omitted to get the same result. Switch to the advanced mode to copy the resulting topology query and put it in the scope field of the metric binding. {% hint syle=\"info\" %} Metric bindings only support the query filters, query functions like withNeighborsOf aren’t supported and can’t be used. {% endhint %} Go to the metric explorer of your SUSE Observability instance, http://your-instance/#/metrics, and use it to query for the metric of interest. The explorer has auto-completion for metrics, labels, label values but also PromQL functions, and operators to help you out. Start with a short time range of, for example, an hour to get the best results. For the total number of replicas use the kubernetes_state_deployment_replicas metric. To make the charts shown for this metric representative for the time series data extend the query to do an aggregation using the ${__interval} parameter: max_over_time(kubernetes_state_deployment_replicas[${__interval}]) In this specific case use max_over_time to make sure the chart always shows the highest number of replicas at any given time. For longer time ranges this means that a short dip in replicas won’t be shown, to emphasize the lowest number of replicas use min_over_time instead. Copy the query into the expression property of the first entry in the queries field of the metric binding. Use Total replicas as an alias. This is the name that will show in the chart legend. In SUSE Observability the size of the metric chart automatically determines the granularity of the metric shown in the chart. PromQL queries can adjusted to make optimal use of this behavior to get a representative chart for the metric. Writing PromQL for charts explains this in detail. The metric binding with all fields filled in: _type: MetricBinding chartType: line enabled: true tags: {} unit: short name: Replica counts priority: MEDIUM identifier: urn:custom:metric-binding:my-deployment-replica-counts queries: - expression: max_over_time(kubernetes_state_deployment_replicas[${__interval}]) alias: Total replicas scope: type = \"deployment\" and label = \"stackpack:kubernetes\" Creating it in SUSE Observability and viewing the \"Replica count\" chart on a deployment component gives an unexpected result. The chart shows the replica counts for all deployments. Logically one would expect only 1 time series: the replica count for this specific deployment. To fix this make the PromQL query specific for a component using information from the component. Filter on enough metric labels to select only the specific time series for the component. This is the \"binding\" of the correct time series to the component. For anyone experienced in making Grafana dashboards this is similar to a dashboard with parameters that are used in queries on the dashboard. Let’s change the query in the metric binding to this: max_over_time(kubernetes_state_deployment_replicas{cluster_name=\"${tags.cluster-name}\", namespace=\"${tags.namespace}\", deployment=\"${name}\"}[${__interval}]) The PromQL query now filters on 3 labels, cluster_name, namespace and deployment. Instead of specifying an actual value for these labels a variable reference to fields of the component is used. In this case the labels cluster-name and namespace are used, referenced using ${tags.cluster-name} and ${tags.namespace}. Further the component name is referenced with ${name}. Supported variable references are: Any component label, using ${tags.} The component name, using ${name} The cluster name, namespace and a combination of the component type and name are ususally enough for selecting the metrics for a specific component from Kubernetes. These labels, or similar labels, are usually available on most metrics and components. Use the SUSE Observability CLI to create the metric binding in SUSE Observability. Make sure the metric-bindings.yaml is saved and looks like this: nodes: - _type: MetricBinding chartType: line enabled: true tags: {} unit: short name: Replica counts priority: MEDIUM identifier: urn:custom:metric-binding:my-deployment-replica-counts queries: - expression: max_over_time(kubernetes_state_deployment_replicas{cluster_name=\"${tags.cluster-name}\", namespace=\"${tags.namespace}\", deployment=\"${name}\"}[${__interval}]) alias: Total replicas scope: type = \"deployment\" and label = \"stackpack:kubernetes\" Use the SUSE Observability CLI to create the metric binding: sts settings apply -f metric-bindings.yaml Verify the results in SUSE Observability by opening the metrics perspective for a deployment. If you’re not happy with the result simply change the metric binding in the YAML file and run the command again to update it. The list of nodes supports adding many metric bindings. Simply add another metric binding entry to the YAML array using the same steps as before. The identifier is used as the unique key of a metric binding. Changing the identifier will create a new metric binding instead of updating the existing one. The sts settings command has more options, for example it can list all metric bindings: sts settings list --type MetricBinding Finally to delete a metric binding use sts settings delete --ids The in this command isn’t the identifier but the number in the Id column of the sts settings list output. The recommended way of working is to store metric bindings (and any other custom resources created in SUSE Observability) as YAML files in a Git repository. From there changes can be manually applied or it can be fully automated by using the SUSE Observability CLI in a CI/CD system like GitHub actions or GitLab pipelines. There is only 1 unit for a metric binding (it gets plotted on the y-axis of the chart). As a result you should only combine queries that produce time series with the same unit in 1 metric binding. Sometimes it might be possible to convert the unit. For example, CPU usage might be reported in milli-cores or cores, milli-cores can be converted to cores by multiplying by 1000 like this () * 1000. There are 2 ways to get more than 1 time series in a single metric binding and therefore in a single chart: Write a PromQL query that returns multiple time series for a single component Add more PromQL queries to the metric binding For the first option an example is given in the next section. The second option can be useful for comparing related metrics. Some typical use-cases: Comparing total replicas vs desired and available Resource usage: limits, requests and usage in a single chart To add more queries to a metric binding simply repeat steps 3. and 4. and add the query as an extra entry in the list of queries. For the deployment replica counts there are several related metrics that can be included in the same chart: nodes: - _type: MetricBinding chartType: line enabled: true tags: {} unit: short name: Replica counts priority: MEDIUM identifier: urn:custom:metric-binding:my-deployment-replica-counts queries: - expression: max_over_time(kubernetes_state_deployment_replicas{cluster_name=\"${tags.cluster-name}\", namespace=\"${tags.namespace}\", deployment=\"${name}\"}[${__interval}]) alias: Total replicas - expression: max_over_time(kubernetes_state_deployment_replicas_available{cluster_name=\"${tags.cluster-name}\", namespace=\"${tags.namespace}\", deployment=\"${name}\"}[${__interval}]) alias: Available - ${cluster_name} - ${namespace} - ${deployment} - expression: max_over_time(kubernetes_state_deployment_replicas_unavailable{cluster_name=\"${tags.cluster-name}\", namespace=\"${tags.namespace}\", deployment=\"${name}\"}[${__interval}]) alias: Unavailable - ${cluster_name} - ${namespace} - ${deployment} - expression: min_over_time(kubernetes_state_deployment_replicas_desired{cluster_name=\"${tags.cluster-name}\", namespace=\"${tags.namespace}\", deployment=\"${name}\"}[${__interval}]) alias: Desired - ${cluster_name} - ${namespace} - ${deployment} scope: type = \"deployment\" and label = \"stackpack:kubernetes\" When a single query returns multiple time series per component, this will show as multiple lines in the chart. But in the legend they will all use the same alias. To be able to see the difference between the different time series the alias can include references to the metric labels using the ${label} syntax. For example here is a metric binding for the \"Container restarts\" metric on a pod, note that a pod can have multiple containers: type: MetricBinding chartType: line enabled: true id: -1 identifier: urn:custom:metric-binding:my-pod-restart-count name: Container restarts priority: MEDIUM queries: - alias: Restarts - ${container} expression: max by (cluster_name, namespace, pod_name, container) (kubernetes_state_container_restarts{cluster_name=\"${tags.cluster-name}\", namespace=\"${tags.namespace}\", pod_name=\"${name}\"}) scope: (label = \"stackpack:kubernetes\" and type = \"pod\") unit: short Note that the alias references the container label of the metric. Make sure the label is present on the query result, when the label is missing the ${container} will be rendered as literal text to help troubleshooting. Each component can be associated with various technologies or protocols such as k8s, networking, runtime environments (e.g., JVM), protocols (HTTP, AMQP), etc. Consequently, a multitude of different metrics can be displayed for each component. For easier readability, SUSE Observability can organize these charts into tabs and sections. To display a chart (MetricBinding) within a specific tab or section, you need to configure the layout property. Any MetricsBinding without a specified layout will be displayed in a tab and section named Other. Here is an example configuration: layout: weight: 100 layouts: - perspective: Metrics tab: name: AMQP weight: 150 section: name: Performance weight: 300 Fields: layout.weight - This represents the weight of the chart within sections. The charts are sorted in ascending order by weight, followed by alphabetical order. layout.layouts - (array) This allows each chart to be added to multiple views (perspectives). layout.layouts.perspective - This is the type of perspective to display the chart. Currently, only the Metrics perspective is supported. Metrics - display on Metrics perspective layout.layouts.tab - This indicates the tab name and its weight. Tabs are sorted ascending by weight (the lowest one from all MetricBinding), followed by alphabetical order. layout.layouts.section - This is the section name and its weight. Sections are sorted alphabetically.","title":"Add custom charts to components","component":"observability","version":"next","name":"k8s-add-charts","url":"/observability/next/en/use/metrics/k8s-add-charts.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Steps","hash":"_steps","id":2},{"text":"Write the outline of the metric binding","hash":"_write_the_outline_of_the_metric_binding","id":3},{"text":"Write the topology query","hash":"_write_the_topology_query","id":4},{"text":"Write the PromQL query","hash":"_write_the_promql_query","id":5},{"text":"Bind the correct time series to each component","hash":"_bind_the_correct_time_series_to_each_component","id":6},{"text":"Create or update the metric binding in SUSE Observability","hash":"_create_or_update_the_metric_binding_in_suse_observability","id":7},{"text":"Other options","hash":"_other_options","id":8},{"text":"More than 1 time series in a chart","hash":"_more_than_1_time_series_in_a_chart","id":9},{"text":"Using metric labels in aliases","hash":"_using_metric_labels_in_aliases","id":10},{"text":"Layouts","hash":"_layouts","id":11}]},"51":{"id":51,"text":"When you have your own on-premise or self-hosted Prometheus running where metrics for your environment are aggregated, you can mirror these metrics in SUSE Observability. This will allow you to use SUSE Observability’s powerful topology and correlation features to troubleshoot your Kubernetes environment without having to switch between tools. To make this possible, SUSE Observability exposes the Prometheus remote_write protocol as an endpoint. Using this endpoint you can configure your Prometheus instance to send metrics to SUSE Observability. The metrics are then automatically ingested, and it will be possible to bind the metrics to the components observed by SUSE Observability. The following diagram shows how this works: To mirror your Prometheus metrics in SUSE Observability, you need to lookup the API Key that’s used to send in metrics into SUSE Observability. The API Key can be found in the description of the installed Kubernetes StackPack in SUSE Observability. The following steps show how to find the API Key: Open the SUSE Observability UI and navigate to the StackPacks page Find the Kubernetes StackPack and click on it. In the description of the StackPack, you will find the API Key that’s used to send in metrics into SUSE Observability. To configure your Prometheus instance to send metrics to SUSE Observability, you need to add a new remote write endpoint to your Prometheus configuration. This can be done by updating the remote_write section in your prometheus.yml file. There are 2 variants that you can use for the authentication to the endpoint, either through a header or through basic authentication. You can authenticate using the API Key by adding the sts-api-key header to the prometheus remote_write requests. The following example shows how to configure this: remote_write: - url: https://.app.stackstate.io/receiver/prometheus/api/v1/write headers: sts-api-key: You can authenticate using basic authentication by adding the basic_auth section to the prometheus remote_write requests. Because the requests to this API are made from a headless service, the username field is set to the static value apikey. The following example shows how to configure this: remote_write: - url: https://.app.stackstate.io/receiver/prometheus/api/v1/write basic_auth: username: apikey password: After the configuration changes have been applied to the Prometheus configuration file, Prometheus needs to be restarted. After the restart, Prometheus will start sending metrics to SUSE Observability.

This also makes SUSE Observability usable with other Prometheus-compatible solutions. Before you can add SUSE Observability as a datasource in Grafana, you need to setup a ServiceToken to authenticate with SUSE Observability.

To get the most representative charts possible follow these guidelines: Don’t query for the raw metric but always aggregate over time (using *_over_time or rate functions). Use the ${__interval} parameter as the range for aggregations over time, it will automatically adjust with the resolution of the chart Use the ${__rate_interval} parameter as the range for rate aggregations, it will also automatically adjust with the resolution of the chart but takes into account specific behaviors of rate. Applying an aggregation often means that a trade-off is made to emphasize certain patterns in metrics more than others. For example, for large time windows max_over_time will show all peaks, but it won’t show all troughs. While min_over_time does the exact opposite and avg_over_time will smooth out both peaks and troughs. To show this behavior, here is an example metric binding using the CPU usage of pods. To try it yourself, copy it to a YAML file and use the CLI to apply it in your own SUSE Observability (you can remove it later). nodes: - _type: MetricBinding chartType: line enabled: true tags: {} unit: short name: CPU Usage (different aggregations and intervals) priority: HIGH identifier: urn:custom:metric-binding:pod-cpu-usage-a queries: - expression: sum(max_over_time(container_cpu_usage{cluster_name=\"${tags.cluster-name}\", namespace=\"${tags.namespace}\", pod_name=\"${name}\"}[${__interval}])) by (cluster_name, namespace, pod_name) /1000000000 alias: max_over_time dynamic interval - expression: sum(min_over_time(container_cpu_usage{cluster_name=\"${tags.cluster-name}\", namespace=\"${tags.namespace}\", pod_name=\"${name}\"}[${__interval}])) by (cluster_name, namespace, pod_name) /1000000000 alias: min_over_time dynamic interval - expression: sum(avg_over_time(container_cpu_usage{cluster_name=\"${tags.cluster-name}\", namespace=\"${tags.namespace}\", pod_name=\"${name}\"}[${__interval}])) by (cluster_name, namespace, pod_name) /1000000000 alias: avg_over_time dynamic interval - expression: sum(last_over_time(container_cpu_usage{cluster_name=\"${tags.cluster-name}\", namespace=\"${tags.namespace}\", pod_name=\"${name}\"}[${__interval}])) by (cluster_name, namespace, pod_name) /1000000000 alias: last_over_time dynamic interval - expression: sum(max_over_time(container_cpu_usage{cluster_name=\"${tags.cluster-name}\", namespace=\"${tags.namespace}\", pod_name=\"${name}\"}[1m])) by (cluster_name, namespace, pod_name) /1000000000 alias: max_over_time 1m interval - expression: sum(min_over_time(container_cpu_usage{cluster_name=\"${tags.cluster-name}\", namespace=\"${tags.namespace}\", pod_name=\"${name}\"}[1m])) by (cluster_name, namespace, pod_name) /1000000000 alias: min_over_time 1m interval - expression: sum(avg_over_time(container_cpu_usage{cluster_name=\"${tags.cluster-name}\", namespace=\"${tags.namespace}\", pod_name=\"${name}\"}[1m])) by (cluster_name, namespace, pod_name) /1000000000 alias: avg_over_time 1m interval - expression: sum(last_over_time(container_cpu_usage{cluster_name=\"${tags.cluster-name}\", namespace=\"${tags.namespace}\", pod_name=\"${name}\"}[1m])) by (cluster_name, namespace, pod_name) /1000000000 alias: last_over_time 1m interval scope: (label = \"stackpack:kubernetes\" and type = \"pod\") After applying it, open the metrics perspective for a pod in SUSE Observability (preferably a pod with some spikes and troughs in CPU usage). Enlarge the chart using the icon in its top-right corner to get a better view. Now you can also change the time window to see what the effects are from the different aggregations (30 minutes vs 24 hours for example). When the metric binding doesn’t specify an aggregation SUSE Observability will automatically use the last_over_time aggregation to reduce the number of data points for a chart. See also Why is this necessary? for an explanation. First of all, why should you use an aggregation? It doesn’t make sense to retrieve more data points from the metric store than fit in the chart. Therefore SUSE Observability automatically determines the step needed between 2 data points to get a good result. For short time windows (for example a chart showing only 1 hour of data) this results in a small step (around 10 seconds). Metrics are often only collected every 30 seconds, so for 10 second steps the same value will repeat for 3 steps before changing to the next value. Zooming out to a 1 week time window, will require a much bigger step (around 1 hour, depending on the exact size of the chart on screen). When the steps become larger than the resolution of the collected data points, a decision needs to be made on how to summarize the data points of the 1 hour time range into a single value. When an aggregation over time is already specified in the query, it will be used to do that. However, if no aggregation is specified, or when the aggregation interval is smaller than the step, the last_over_time aggregation is used, with the step size as the interval. The result is that only the last data point for each hour is used to \"summarize\" the all data points in that hour. To summarize, when executing a PromQL query for a time range of 1 week with a step of 1 hour this query: container_cpu_usage /1000000000 is automatically converted to: last_over_time(container_cpu_usage[1h]) /1000000000 Try it for yourself on the SUSE Observability playground. Often this behavior isn’t intended and it’s better to decide for yourself what kind of aggregation is needed. Using different aggregation functions it’s possible to emphasize certain behavior (at the cost of hiding other behavior). Is it more important to see peaks, troughs, a smooth chart etc.? Then use the ${__interval} parameter for the range as it’s automatically replaced with the step size used for the query. The result is that all the data points in the step are used. The ${__interval} parameter prevents another issue. When the step size and therefore the ${__interval} value, would shrink to a smaller size than the resolution of the stored metric data this would result in gaps in the chart. Therefore ${__interval} will never shrink smaller than the 2* the default scrape interval (default scrape interval is 30 seconds) of the SUSE Observability agent. Finally the rate() function requires at least 2 data points to be in the interval to calculate a rate at all. With less than 2 data points the rate won’t have a value. Therefore ${__rate_interval} is guaranteed to always be at least 4 * the scrape interval. This guarantees no unexpected gaps or other strange behavior in rate charts, unless data is missing. There are some excellent blog posts on the internet that explain this in more detail: Step and query range What range should I use with rate()?

The charts for custom metric bindings will be shown in the Metrics perspective only. The scope query on a metric binding is used to determine whether a component shows the metric binding. If a component doesn’t show a metric binding check that the topology query in the scope matches the component. First check that the component indeed has the expected labels and/or component type on the component highlights page, name and type are at the top, the labels are in the \"About\" section. Make sure there are no spelling mistakes in label names or values. Check that the scope query has the correct syntax: Open the explore view, via Views in the menu and the blue \"Explore\" button on the right. Or directly via the URL: https:///#/views/explore Open the filters and select switch to STQL Now copy/paste the query from the scope into the STQL field and run the query The overview now shows all components that match the query and that will get the chart. For the metric chart that has no data while data was expected open the inspector (the icon on the top-right corner of the chart). Toggle the \"Show query\" button to show the queries. Make sure the query doesn’t contain any of the parameters anymore (i.e. all values like ${tags.cluster-name} or ${name}) have been replaced with the values for the component. If some parameters were left behind in the query the labels were not available on this component. So cross-check the names used (in this example cluster-name) against the labels available on the component. Also make sure there are no typos in the names. If all parameters are filled in there may be an issue with the PromQL query. To investigate that copy the PromQL query and open the Metrics explorer (via the main menu of SUSE Observability). Paste the query into the metric explorer and run it. This should still give an empty result. Either the metric doesn’t exist, it doesn’t have one of the labels or the label does exist but there are no time series matching the value. The fastest method to resolve this is to rewrite the query to only its metric name and run that, if there are results the metric exists (so no typos). The table result can also be used to verify that all the labels that are used exist. Make sure there are no typos here either. If there are results, but just not for a specific value of a label (for example for the pod_name label) the query is ok but there is no time series for this specific metric for this specific component. Things to check in this case: Is the data collected for this component (either via the SUSE Observability agent or some other means)? Is the component even reporting the metric? How to do this depends on how data collection is configured.","title":"Troubleshooting custom metric charts","component":"observability","version":"next","name":"k8sTs-metrics-troubleshooting","url":"/observability/next/en/use/metrics/k8sTs-metrics-troubleshooting.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"The metric chart doesn’t show on the Highlights page of a component","hash":"_the_metric_chart_doesnt_show_on_the_highlights_page_of_a_component","id":2},{"text":"The metric chart doesn’t show on the metrics perspective of a component","hash":"_the_metric_chart_doesnt_show_on_the_metrics_perspective_of_a_component","id":3},{"text":"The metric chart on a component remains empty (\"no data\")","hash":"_the_metric_chart_on_a_component_remains_empty_no_data","id":4}]},"56":{"id":56,"text":"SUSE Observability Agent V2 can be configured to retrieve metrics from an OpenMetrics endpoint and push these to SUSE Observability.

To zoom in on an event bar of interest, click and drag to select a smaller telemetry interval around it on the timeline. A single click on the timeline will move the play head to this point in time, and thus time travel to the state of the topology at the selected topology time.

Add or remove a custom view from the starred views by simply clicking the star icon next to its name. To create a new custom view, click the Save view as…​ blue button on the top navigation bar when you’re on a kubernetes view or an explore view. To create a new view from a modified custom view, use the dropdown menu next to the button and select Save view as…​. In the Save view as dialog, the following options can be set: Field Name Description View name The name of the view. Description A short description for the view. It helps remembering the scope of the view. View health state enabled Whether the view has a health state or not. If this is enable, the view health state is calculated based on the configuration function below. Configuration function When view health state is enabled, you can choose a function that’s used to calculate the view health state whenever there are changes in the view. The default choice is minimum health states - this function calculates the health state of the view based on the amount of components in CRITICAL or DEVIATING state in the view. Arguments The required arguments will vary depending on the chosen configuration function, if any. Identifier A unique reference for the view, helpful when you want to reference the view from an exported configuration, such as the exported configuration in a StackPack. When a custom view is created, all the filters, visualization options, view settings and the timeline configuration are saved on the view. If you want to reset the custom view to its original state after you have made some changes to it, use the dropdown menu next to the Save…​ button on the top navigation bar and select Reset view.

But, often times when you need to investigate a subset of a particular view, you don’t want to lose the scope of that view. This is where the explore views come into play. To keep the scope of a particular view (e.g. my view) intact, all the investigative actions applied to a topology element or selection of elements (e.g. components, relations, groups) will automatically open in a temporary explore view, under the view you have started from (e.g. my view / explore). Examples of investigative actions that will automatically be opened in an explore view: The + button was clicked on a component in the topology perspective to show the hidden neighbors of that component A quick action was executed on a component A topology element (component, relation, group) was double-clicked in the topology perspective to investigate it The 'Explore…​' link or button was clicked on a topology element (component, relation, group) to investigate it The investigative actions executed from an existing explore view will not open a new explore view - they will change the scope of the explore view you are in. When an explore view is automatically created, its original scope is also defined. This is helpful if you want to reset the explore view to its original scope after you have made some changes to it. Although an explore view is meant to be temporary, it can be saved as a custom view if you want to monitor it or review it later on. If you don’t want to save an explore view, simply move away from it or go back to the view you started from by using the breadcrumbs on the top navigation bar.

Once applied, the filters will affect the content of all the perspectives in a view. Topology filters can be used to select a sub-set of topology components to be shown in any one of the available perspectives. While the events filter is the same for all the view types, the topology filters depend on the type of view you are in. Read more: Topology filters on Kubernetes views Topology filters on other view types On the kubernetes views, the topology filters are limited to a small set of basic filters that persist across all the Kubernetes views: clusters and / or namespaces. The persistent topology filters for Kubernetes views are placed outside the regular filters menu in the UI and are not interdependent on each other (e.g. selecting a cluster does not automatically update the namespaces filter to reflect only the namespaces of that cluster). For other view types, you can browse your topology using basic or advanced topology filters. Read more about: Basic topology filters Advanced topology filters Topology filtering limits The main way to filter topology is using the available basic filters. When you set a filter, the open perspective will update to show only the visualization or data for the subset of your topology that matches the filter. Setting multiple filters will narrow down your search further. You can set more than one value for each filter to expand your search Filter Description Layers, Domains, Environments and Component types Filter by the component details included when components are imported or created. Component health Only include components with the named health state as reported by the associated health check. Component labels Only include components with a specific label. Include components Components named here will be included in the topology in addition to the components returned from other filters. To filter the topology using basic filters, click the Filters menu in the top right corner of the UI and select Switch to basic under the Topology vertical tab. You can use the in-built SUSE Observability Query Language (STQL) to build an advanced topology filter that zooms in on a specific area of your topology. To filter the topology using an STQL query, click the Filters menu in the top right corner of the UI and select Switch to STQL under the Topology vertical tab. The STQL query example below will return components that match the following conditions: In the Domain security check AND has a Health state of Clear OR Deviating OR is the Component with the name ai_engine (domain IN (\"security check\") AND healthstate IN (\"CLEAR\", \"DEVIATING\")) OR name IN (\"ai_engine\") You can switch between basic and advanced filtering by selecting Switch to basic or Switch to STQL under the Topology vertical tab in the Filters menu. It’s always possible to switch from basic to advanced filtering. The selected basic filters will be converted directly to an STQL query. For simple queries it’s also possible to switch from advanced to basic filtering, however, some advanced queries aren’t compatible with basic filters. ➡️ Learn more about the compatibility of basic and advanced topology filters The advanced filters listed below are compatible with basic filtering, but can’t be set or adjusted as a basic filter. withNeighborsOf - when an advanced filter includes the function withNeighborsOf, the number of components whose neighbors are queried for is shown in the Other filters box. To be compatible with basic filtering, a withNeighborsOf function must be joined to other filters using an OR operator. identifier - when an advanced filter selects components by identifier, the number of component identifiers queried is reported in the Other filters box. To be compatible with basic filtering, an identifier filter must be specified and joined to other filters using the operator OR identifier IN (...). The Other filters box in the basic topology filters lists all these advanced filters and the number of affected components. The Other filters box only gives details of advanced filters that have been set and are compatible with basic filtering. To optimize performance, a limit is placed on the amount of elements that can be loaded to produce a topology visualization. The filtering limit has a default value of 10000 elements. If a basic filter or advanced filter query exceeds the filtering limit, a message will be shown on screen and no topology visualization will be displayed. Note that the filtering limit is applied to the total amount of elements that need to be loaded and not the amount of elements that will ultimately be displayed. In the example below, we first LOAD all neighbors of every component in our topology and then DISPLAY only the ones that belong to the applications layer. This would likely fail with a filtering limit error as it requires all components in the topology to be loaded. withNeighborsOf(direction = \"both\", components = (name = \"*\"), levels = \"15\") AND layer = \"applications\" To successfully produce this topology visualization, we would need to either re-write the query to keep the number of components loaded below the configured filtering limit, or increase the filtering limit. By fitering for only components in the applications layer, we will DISPLAY the same components as the query above, without first needing to LOAD all components. This query is therefore less likely to result in a filtering limit error. layer = \"applications\" The View Filters panel on the left of the SUSE Observability UI can be used to filter the events shown in the Events Perspective. They’re also included in the Event list in the right panel View summary tab and the details tabs - Component details and Direct relation details. The following event filters are available: Filter Description Category Show only events from one or more categories. Type Click the Type filter box to open a list of all event types that have been generated for the currently filtered components in the current time window. You can select one or more event types to refine the events displayed. Source Events can be generated by SUSE Observability or retrieved from an external source system, such as Kubernetes or ServiceNow, by an integration. Click the Source filter box to open a list of all source systems for events that have been generated for the currently filtered components in the current time window. Select one or more source systems to see only those events. Tags Relevant event properties will be added as tags when an event is retrieved from an external system. For example status:open or status:production. This can help to identify events relevant to a specific problem or environment.","title":"Filters","component":"observability","version":"next","name":"k8s-filters","url":"/observability/next/en/use/views/k8s-filters.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Filter topology","hash":"_filter_topology","id":2},{"text":"Topology filters on Kubernetes views","hash":"_topology_filters_on_kubernetes_views","id":3},{"text":"Topology filters on other view types","hash":"_topology_filters_on_other_view_types","id":4},{"text":"Basic topology filters","hash":"_basic_topology_filters","id":5},{"text":"Advanced topology filters","hash":"_advanced_topology_filters","id":6},{"text":"Compatibility of basic and advanced filters","hash":"_compatibility_of_basic_and_advanced_filters","id":7},{"text":"Other filters","hash":"_other_filters","id":8},{"text":"Topology filtering limits","hash":"_topology_filtering_limits","id":9},{"text":"Filter events","hash":"_filter_events","id":10}]},"71":{"id":71,"text":"The highlights page shows an overview of the most important information about a specific Kubernetes resource.

The way components and relations are displayed in the topology perspective can be customized in the visualization settings menu in the top right corner of the visualizer. The Visualization Settings are saved together with the View. The components in the topology perspective can optionally be organized in a grid, with layers grouped in rows and domains visualized as columns. The grid is turned on by default. When no grid options are selected, no grid is displayed. Organize by layers - Components of the same layer are placed in the same grid row in the topology visualization. Disable to remove the rows from the grid. Organize by domains - Components of the same domain are placed in the same grid column in the topology visualization. Disable to remove the columns from the grid. For example, if you have a business service visualization of a stack that comes from four or five different sources, the source (domain) they’re coming from won’t be so important in the visualization. This could be a good situation to visualize the topology with organize by domains switched off. Topology visualizations of large numbers of components can become hard to read. SUSE Observability can group together components within the same view. Grouping brings the number of components and relations down to something visually more manageable. Grouping is enabled by default and respects the selected grid options - components must be in the same grid row/column to be grouped together. Three types of grouping are available, or you can choose not to group components together: No grouping - Components and relations aren’t grouped in any way. Auto grouping - Grouping settings are automatically adjusted to keep the number of components or component groups visualized below 35. Group by state and type - Components of the same type and with the same health state are grouped together into one group. If one of the grouped components changes its health state and no longer matches the health state of the component group, it will pop out of the group. If other components of the same type have the same health state, a new group will be created. Group by type, state and relation - Components are grouped together as with group by state and type while maintaining information about relations to components outside of the group. All components in a group have the same source and target connection. This is useful because grouping components together by state and type alone can cause some information on relations for the components in the group to be lost. There are zoom buttons located in the bottom right corner of the topology visualizer. The plus button zooms in on the topology, the minus button zooms out. In between both buttons is the fit to screen button which zooms out so the complete topology becomes visible. You can locate a specific component in the topology by clicking CTRL + SHIFT + F and typing the first few letters of the component name. Alternatively, you can select the Find component magnifying glass icon in the bottom right corner of the topology visualizer. See the full list of SUSE Observability keyboard shortcuts. If there are components with monitors on them which are outside the view but might influence the component in the view, the Topology Perspective will show the health state of all components shown. Don’t show root cause - Don’t show the root causes of components shown by the current topology filters. Show root cause only - Only show the root causes of components shown by the current topology filters that have a CRITICAL or DEVIATING propagated health.

The following data can be automatically backed up: Configuration and topology data stored in StackGraph is backed up when the Helm value backup.stackGraph.enabled is set to true. Metrics stored in SUSE Observability’s Victoria Metrics instance(s) is backed up when the Helm value victoria-metrics-0.backup.enabled and victoria-metrics-1.backup.enabled are set to true. Telemetry data stored in SUSE Observability’s Elasticsearch instance is backed up when the Helm value backup.elasticsearch.enabled is set to true. OpenTelemetry data stored in SUSE Observability’s ClickHouse instance is backed up when the Helm value clickhouse.backup.enabled is set to true. The following data will not be backed up: In transit topology and telemetry updates stored in Kafka - these only have temporary value and would be of no use when a backup is restored Master node negotiations state stored in ZooKeeper - this runtime state would be incorrect when restored and will be automatically determined at runtime Kubernetes configuration state and raw persistent volume state - this state can be rebuilt by re-installing SUSE Observability and restoring the backups. Kubernetes logs - these are ephemeral. Backups are sent to an instance of MinIO (min.io), which is automatically started by the stackstate Helm chart when automatic backups are enabled. MinIO is an object storage system with the same API as AWS S3. It can store its data locally or act as a gateway to AWS S3 (min.io), Azure BLob Storage (min.io) and other systems. The built-in MinIO instance can be configured to store the backups in three locations: AWS S3 Azure Blob Storage Kubernetes storage Encryption Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) should be used when encrypting S3 buckets that store the backups. ⚠️ Encryption with AWS KMS keys stored in AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS) isn’t supported.

These credentials are set on the MinIO system and used by the automatic backup jobs and the restore jobs. They’re also required if you want to manually access the MinIO system. YOUR_ACCESS_KEY should contain 5 to 20 alphanumerical characters. YOUR_SECRET_KEY should contain 8 to 40 alphanumerical characters. AWS_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_SECRET_KEY are the AWS credentials for the IAM user that has access to the S3 buckets where the backups will be stored. See below for the permission policy that needs to be attached to that user. AWS_STACKGRAPH_BUCKET, AWS_ELASTICSEARCH_BUCKET, AWS_VICTORIA_METRICS_BUCKET and AWS_CLICKHOUSE_BUCKET are the names of the S3 buckets where the backups should be stored. Note: The names of AWS S3 buckets are global across the whole of AWS, therefore the S3 buckets with the default name (sts-elasticsearch-backup, sts-stackgraph-backup, sts-victoria-metrics-backup and sts-clickhouse-backup ) will probably not be available. The IAM user identified by AWS_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_SECRET_KEY must be configured with the following permission policy to access the S3 buckets: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Sid\": \"AllowListMinioBackupBuckets\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"s3:ListBucket\", \"s3:GetBucketLocation\" ], \"Resource\": [ \"arn:aws:s3:::AWS_STACKGRAPH_BUCKET\", \"arn:aws:s3:::AWS_ELASTICSEARCH_BUCKET\", \"arn:aws:s3:::AWS_VICTORIA_METRICS_BUCKET\", \"arn:aws:s3:::AWS_CLICKHOUSE_BUCKET\" ] }, { \"Sid\": \"AllowWriteMinioBackupBuckets\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"s3:PutObject\", \"s3:GetObject\", \"s3:DeleteObject\" ], \"Resource\": [ \"arn:aws:s3:::AWS_STACKGRAPH_BUCKET/*\", \"arn:aws:s3:::AWS_ELASTICSEARCH_BUCKET/*\", \"arn:aws:s3:::AWS_VICTORIA_METRICS_BUCKET/*\", \"arn:aws:s3:::AWS_CLICKHOUSE_BUCKET/*\" ] } ] } To enable backups to an Azure Blob Storage account, add the following YAML fragment to the Helm values.yaml file used to install SUSE Observability: backup: enabled: true minio: accessKey: AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME secretKey: AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY azuregateway: enabled: true Replace the following values: AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME - the Azure storage account name (learn.microsoft.com) AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY - the Azure storage account key (learn.microsoft.com) where the backups should be stored. The StackGraph, Elasticsearch and Victoria Metrics backups are stored in BLOB containers called sts-stackgraph-backup, sts-elasticsearch-backup, sts-victoria-metrics-backup, sts-clickhouse-backup respectively. These names can be changed by setting the Helm values backup.stackGraph.bucketName, backup.elasticsearch.bucketName, victoria-metrics-0.backup.bucketName, victoria-metrics-1.backup.bucketName and clickhouse.backup.bucketName respectively. If MinIO is configured to store its data in Kubernetes storage, a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is used to request storage from the Kubernetes cluster. The kind of storage allocated depends on the configuration of the cluster. It’s advised to use AWS S3 for clusters running on Amazon AWS and Azure Blob Storage for clusters running on Azure for the following reasons: Kubernetes clusters running in a cloud provider usually map PVCs to block storage, such as Elastic Block Storage for AWS or Azure Block Storage. Block storage is expensive, especially for large data volumes. Persistent Volumes are destroyed when the cluster that created them is destroyed. That means an (accidental) deletion of your cluster will also destroy all backups stored in Persistent Volumes. Persistent Volumes can’t be accessed from another cluster. That means that it isn’t possible to restore SUSE Observability from a backup taken on another cluster. To enable backups to cluster-local storage, enable MinIO by adding the following YAML fragment to the Helm values.yaml file used to install SUSE Observability: backup: enabled: true minio: accessKey: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY secretKey: YOUR_SECRET_KEY persistence: enabled: true Replace the following values: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY and YOUR_SECRET_KEY - the credentials that will be used to secure the MinIO system. The automatic backup jobs and the restore jobs will use them. They’re also required to manually access the MinIO storage. YOUR_ACCESS_KEY should contain 5 to 20 alphanumerical characters and YOUR_SECRET_KEY should contain 8 to 40 alphanumerical characters. Configuration and topology data (StackGraph) backups are full backups, stored in a single file with the extension .graph. Each file contains a full backup and can be moved, copied or deleted as required. When backup.enabled is set to true, scheduled StackGraph backups are enabled by default. To disable scheduled StackGraph backups only, set the Helm value backup.stackGraph.scheduled.enabled to false. When backup.enabled is set to true, StackGraph restores are enabled by default. To disable StackGraph restore functionality only, set the Helm value backup.stackGraph.restore.enabled to false. By default, the StackGraph backups are created daily at 03:00 AM server time. The backup schedule can be configured using the Helm value backup.stackGraph.scheduled.schedule, specified in Kubernetes cron schedule syntax (kubernetes.io). By default, the StackGraph backups are kept for 30 days. As StackGraph backups are full backups, this can require a lot of storage. The backup retention delta can be configured using the Helm value backup.stackGraph.scheduled.backupRetentionTimeDelta, specified in Python timedelta format (python.org). Victoria Metrics use incremental backups without versioning of a bucket, it means that the new backup replaces completely the previous one. In case you run into one of the following situations: mount an empty volume to /storage directory of Victoria Metrics instances delete the /storage directory or files inside from Victoria Metrics instances The next (empty) backup created will be labeled with a new version and the previous one, before the volume was emptied, will be preserved. Both backups will be from that moment on listed as available for restore. Metrics (Victoria Metrics) use instant snapshots to store data in incremental backups. Many instances of Victoria Metrics can store backups to the same bucket, each of them will be stored in separated directory. All files located in the directory should be treated as a single whole and can only be moved, copied or deleted as a whole. High Available deployments should be deployed with two instances of Victoria Metrics. Backups are enabled/configured independently for each of them. The following code snippets/commands are provided for the first instance of Victoria Metric victoria-metrics-0. To backup/configure the second instance you should use victoria-metrics-1 Backups of Victoria Metrics are disabled by default. To enabled scheduled Victoria Metrics backups, set the Helm value victoria-metrics-0.backup.enabled to true. Victoria Metrics backups requires to enable backups. Restore functionality of Victoria Metrics are disabled by default. To enabled restore functionality of Victoria Metrics, set the Helm value victoria-metrics-0.restore.enabled to true. Victoria Metrics restore functionality requires to enable backups. By default, the Victoria Metrics backups are created every 1h: victoria-metrics-0 - 25 minutes past the hour victoria-metrics-1 - 35 minutes past the hour The backup schedule can be configured using the Helm value victoria-metrics-0.backup.scheduled.schedule according cronexpr format ClickHouse uses both incremental and full backups. By default, full backups are executed daily at 00:45 am, and incremental backups are performed every hour. Each backup creates a new directory, old backups (directories) are deleted automatically. All files located in a backup directory should be treated as a single whole and can only be moved, copied or deleted as a whole. We recommend to uses clickhouse-backup tool to manage backups. The tool is available on the stackstate-clickhouse-shard0-0 Pod. Backups of the ClickHouse are disabled by default. To enabled scheduled ClickHouse backups, set the Helm value clickhouse.backup.enabled to true. ClickHouse backups requires to enable backups. Restore functionality of the ClickHouse are disabled by default. To enabled restore functionality of the ClickHouse, set the Helm value clickhouse.restore.enabled to true. ClickHouse restore functionality requires to enable backups. By default, the ClickHouse backups are created: Full Backup - at 00:45 every day Incremental Backup - 45 minutes past the hour (from 3 am to 12 am) Backups struggle with parallel execution. If a second backup starts before the first one completes, it will disrupt the first backup. Therefore, it’s crucial to avoid parallel execution. For instance, the first incremental backup should be executed three hours after the full one. The backup schedule can be configured using the Helm value clickhouse.backup.scheduled.full_schedule and clickhouse.backup.scheduled.incremental_schedule according cronexpr format By default, the tooling keeps last 308 backups (full and incremental) what is equal to ~14 days. The backup retention can be configured using the Helm value clickhouse.backup.config.keep_remote. The telemetry data (Elasticsearch) snapshots are incremental and stored in files with the extension .dat. The files in the Elasticsearch backup storage location should be treated as a single whole and can only be moved, copied or deleted as a whole. The configuration snippets provided in the section enable backups will enable daily Elasticsearch snapshots. When backup.enabled is set to true, scheduled Elasticsearch snapshots are enabled by default. To disable scheduled Elasticsearch snapshots only, set the Helm value backup.elasticsearch.scheduled.enabled to false. When backup.enabled is set to true, Elasticsearch restores are enabled by default. To disable Elasticsearch restore functionality only, set the Helm value backup.elasticsearch.restore.enabled to false. By default, Elasticsearch snapshots are created daily at 03:00 AM server time. The backup schedule can be configured using the Helm value backup.elasticsearch.scheduled.schedule, specified in Elasticsearch cron schedule syntax (elastic.co). By default, Elasticsearch snapshots are kept for 30 days, with a minimum of 5 snapshots and a maximum of 30 snapshots. The retention time and number of snapshots kept can be configured using the following Helm values: backup.elasticsearch.scheduled.snapshotRetentionExpireAfter, specified in Elasticsearch time units (elastic.co). backup.elasticsearch.scheduled.snapshotRetentionMinCount backup.elasticsearch.scheduled.snapshotRetentionMaxCount By default, the retention task itself runs daily at 1:30 AM UTC (elastic.co). If you set snapshots to expire faster than within a day, for example for testing purposes, you will need to change the schedule for the retention task. By default, a snapshot is created for Elasticsearch indices with names that start with sts. The indices for which a snapshot is created can be configured using the Helm value backup.elasticsearch.scheduled.indices, specified in JSON array format (w3schools.com). Scripts to list and restore backups and snapshots can be found in the restore directory of the SUSE Observability Helm chart repository (github.com). To use the scripts, download them from GitHub or checkout the repository. Before you use the scripts, ensure that: The kubectl binary is installed and configured to connect to: The Kubernetes cluster where SUSE Observability has been installed. The namespace within that cluster where SUSE Observability has been installed. The following Helm values have been correctly set: backup.enabled is set to true. backup.stackGraph.restore.enabled isn’t set to false (to access StackGraph backups). backup.elasticsearch.restore.enabled isn’t set to false (to access Elasticsearch snapshots). victoria-metrics-0.restore.enabled or victoria-metrics-1.restore.enabled isn’t set to false (to access Victoria Metrics snapshots). To list the StackGraph backups, execute the following command: ./restore/list-stackgraph-backups.sh The output should look like this: job.batch/stackgraph-list-backups-20210222t111942 created Waiting for job to start... === Listing StackGraph backups in bucket \"sts-stackgraph-backup\"... sts-backup-20210215-0300.graph sts-backup-20210216-0300.graph sts-backup-20210217-0300.graph sts-backup-20210218-0300.graph sts-backup-20210219-0300.graph sts-backup-20210220-0300.graph sts-backup-20210221-0300.graph sts-backup-20210222-0300.graph === job.batch \"stackgraph-list-backups-20210222t111942\" deleted The timestamp when the backup was taken is part of the backup name.

For example, it’s possible to customize the tolerations and nodeSelectors for each of the components. You can also add customized configuration and include environment variables For the SUSE Observability api service, custom configuration can be dropped directly into the Helm chart. This is the advised way to override the default configuration that SUSE Observability ships with and is especially convenient for customizing authentication. Configuration set in this way will be available to the SUSE Observability configuration file in HOCON format. For example, you can set a custom \"forgot password link\" for the SUSE Observability login page: {% tabs %} {% tab title=\"values.yaml\" %} stackstate: components: api: config: | stackstate.api.authentication.forgotPasswordLink = \"https://www.stackstate.com/forgotPassword.html\" {% endtab %} {% endtabs %} Note that custom configuration set here will be overridden by environment variables.

OpenShift: Refer to the OpenShift installation instructions. Before you start the installation of SUSE Observability: Check the requirements to make sure that your Kubernetes environment fits the setup that you will use (recommended, minimal or non- high availability). Check that you have the required permissions. Add the SUSE Observability helm repository to the local helm client: helm repo add suse-observability https://charts.rancher.com/server-charts/prime/suse-observability helm repo update For environments without internet access, also known as air-gapped environments, first follow these extra instructions. Also make sure to follow the air-gapped installation instructions whenever those are present for a step. Create the namespace where SUSE Observability will be installed Generate baseConfig_values.yaml and sizing_values.yaml Deploy SUSE Observability with Helm Access the SUSE Observability UI Start by creating the namespace where you want to install SUSE Observability and deploy the secret in that namespace. In our walkthrough we will use the namespace suse-observability: kubectl create namespace suse-observability The baseConfig_values.yaml file is required to deploy StackState with Helm. It contains your StackState license key, StackState Receiver API key and other important information. The sizing_values.yaml file is recommended to deploy StackState with Helm as it contains information about the resources that StackState will be provisioned with according to the size on the landscape you want to observe. Before you continue: Make sure you have the latest version of the Helm charts with helm repo update. The SUSE Observability baseConfig_values.yaml and sizing_values.yaml files can be generated by running a separate Helm Chart, the suse-observability/suse-observability-values chart. A sample command line is: export VALUES_DIR=. helm template \\ --set license='' \\ --set baseUrl='' \\ --set sizing.profile='' \\ suse-observability-values \\ suse-observability/suse-observability-values --output-dir $VALUES_DIR This command will generate a $VALUES_DIR/suse-observability-values/templates/baseConfig_values.yaml and a $VALUES_DIR/suse-observability-values/templates/sizing_values.yaml file which contains the necessary configuration for installing the SUSE Observability Helm Chart. The SUSE Observability administrator passwords will be autogenerated by the above command and are output as comments in the generated basicConfig.yaml file. The actual values contain the bcrypt hashes of those passwords so that they’re securely stored in the Helm release in the cluster. The values that can be passed to this chart are: Configuration Value Description Basic Config generate basicConfig.generate Switch on or off the generation of the basicConfig_values.yaml file. Receiver API Key receiverApiKey The API key used by SUSE Observability to receive data from agents. This is a secret key that should be kept private. If you omit this, a random key will be generated for you. Base URL baseUrl The . The external URL for SUSE Observability that users and agents will use to connect. For example https://suse-observability.internal. If you haven’t decided on an Ingress configuration yet, use http://localhost:8080. This can be updated later in the generated file. Username and password** -u -p The username and password used by SUSE Observability to pull images. For air-gapped environments these need to be the username and password for the local contaier registry. License key license The SUSE Observability license key. Admin API password adminApiPassword The password for the admin API. Note that this API contains system maintenance functionality and should only be accessible by the maintainers of the SUSE Observability installation. If you omit this, a random password will be generated for you. If you do pass this value and it’s not bcrypt hashed, the chart will hash it for you. Default password adminPassword The password for the default user (admin) to access SUSE Observability’s UI. If you omit this, a random password will be generated for you. If you do pass this value and it’s not bcrypt hashed, the chart will hash it for you. Image Registry imageRegistry The registry where the SUSE Observability images are hosted. If not provided, the default value will be 'quay.io' Pull Secret Username pullSecret.username The username used to pull images from the Docker registry where the SUSE Observability images are hosted. Only needed for custom registries. Pull Secret Password pullSecret.password The password used to pull images from the Docker registry where the SUSE Observability images are hosted. Only needed for custom registries. Sizing generate sizing.generate Switch on or off the generation of the sizing_values.yaml file. Sizing profile sizing.profile OneOf trial, 10-nonha, 20-nonha, 50-nonha, 100-nonha, 150-ha, 250-ha, 500-ha. Based on this profiles the sizing_values.yaml file is generated containing default sizes for the SUSE Observability resources and configuration to be deployed on an Ha or NonHa mode. E.g. 10-nonha will produce a sizing_values.yaml meant to deploy a NonHa SUSE Observability instance to observe a 10 node cluster in a Non High Available mode. Currently moving from a nonha to an ha environment is not possible, so if you expect that your environment willrequire to observe around 150 nodes then better to go with ha immediately. Store the generated basicConfig.yaml and sizing_values.yaml files somewhere safe. You can reuse this files for upgrades, which will save time and (more importantly) will ensure that SUSE Observability continues to use the same API key. This is desirable as it means Agents and other data providers for SUSE Observability won’t need to be updated. The files can be regenerated independently using the switches basicConfig.generate=false and sizing.generate=false to disable any of them while still keeping the previosuly generated version of the file in the output-dir. The recommended deployment of SUSE Observability is a production ready, high availability setup with many services running redundantly. If required, it’s also possible to run SUSE Observability in a non-redundant setup, where each service has only a single replica. This setup is only recommended for a test environment.

The example on this page shows how to configure an nginx-ingress controller using Helm for SUSE Observability running on Kubernetes. This page also documents which service/port combination to expose when using a different method of configuring ingress traffic. When observing the cluster that also hosts SUSE Observability, the agent traffic can be kept entirely within the cluster itself by changing the agent configuration during agent installation.

To configure the ingress for SUSE Observability, create a file ingress_values.yaml with contents like below. Replace MY_DOMAIN with your own domain (that’s linked with your ingress controller) and set the correct name for the tls-secret. Consult the documentation of your ingress controller for the correct annotations to set. All fields below are optional, for example, if no TLS will be used, omit that section but be aware that SUSE Observability also doesn’t encrypt the traffic. ingress: enabled: true annotations: nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: \"50m\" hosts: - host: stackstate.MY_DOMAIN tls: - hosts: - stackstate.MY_DOMAIN secretName: tls-secret The thing that stands out in this file is the Nginx annotation to increase the allowed proxy-body-size to 50m (larger than any expected request).

To make SUSE Observability accessible outside of the Kubernetes cluster it’s installed in, it’s enough to route traffic to port 8080 of the -stackstate-k8s-router service. The UI of SUSE Observability can be accessed directly under the root path of that service (i.e. http://-stackstate-k8s-router:8080) while agents will use the /receiver path (http://-stackstate-k8s-router:8080/receiver). Make sure to update the baseUrl in the values file generated during initial installation, it will be used by SUSE Observability to generate convenient installation instructions for the agent. When manually configuring an Nginx or similar HTTP server as reverse proxy make sure that it can proxy websockets as well. For Nginx this can be configured by including the following directives in the location directive: proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade; proxy_set_header Connection \"Upgrade\"; SUSE Observability itself doesn’t use TLS encrypted traffic, TLS encryption is expected to be handled by the ingress controller or external load balancers. Agents that are deployed to the same cluster as SUSE Observability can of course use the external URL on which SUSE Observability is exposed, but it’s also possible to configure the agent to directly connect to the SUSE Observability instance via the Kubernetes internal network only. To do that replace the value of the 'stackstate.url' in the helm install command from the Agent Kubernetes installation with the internal cluster URL for the router service (see also above): http://-suse-observability-router..svc.cluster.local:8080/receiver/stsAgent (the sections need to be replaced with the namespace of SUSE Observability).

Kubernetes: Refer to the Kubernetes installation instructions. Before you start the installation of SUSE Observability: Check that your OpenShift environment meets the requirements Ensure you have the OpenShift command line tools installed (oc) Add the SUSE Observability helm repository to the local helm client: helm repo add suse-observability https://charts.rancher.com/server-charts/prime/suse-observability helm repo update For environments without internet access, also known as air-gapped environments, first follow these extra instructions. Also make sure to follow the air-gapped installation instructions whenever those are present for a step. Create the project where SUSE Observability will be installed Generate baseConfig_values.yaml and sizing_values.yaml Create the openshift-values.yaml file Deploy SUSE Observability with Helm Access the SUSE Observability UI Manually create SecurityContextConfiguration objects Start by creating the project where you want to install SUSE Observability. In our walkthrough we will use the namespace suse-observability: oc new-project suse-observability The project name is used in helm and kubectl commands as the namespace name in the --namespace flag The baseConfig_values.yaml file is required to deploy StackState with Helm. It contains your StackState license key, StackState Receiver API key and other important information. The sizing_values.yaml file is recommended to deploy StackState with Helm as it contains information about the resources that StackState will be provisioned with according to the size on the landscape you want to observe. Before you continue: Make sure you have the latest version of the Helm charts with helm repo update. The SUSE Observability baseConfig_values.yaml and sizing_values.yaml files can be generated by running a separate Helm Chart, the suse-observability/suse-observability-values chart. A sample command line is: export VALUES_DIR=. helm template \\ --set license='' \\ --set baseUrl='' \\ --set sizing.profile='' \\ suse-observability-values \\ suse-observability/suse-observability-values --output-dir $VALUES_DIR This command will generate a $VALUES_DIR/suse-observability-values/templates/baseConfig_values.yaml and a $VALUES_DIR/suse-observability-values/templates/sizing_values.yaml file which contains the necessary configuration for installing the SUSE Observability Helm Chart. The SUSE Observability administrator passwords will be autogenerated by the above command and are output as comments in the generated basicConfig.yaml file. The actual values contain the bcrypt hashes of those passwords so that they’re securely stored in the Helm release in the cluster. The values that can be passed to this chart are: Configuration Value Description Basic Config generate basicConfig.generate Switch on or off the generation of the basicConfig_values.yaml file. Receiver API Key receiverApiKey The API key used by SUSE Observability to receive data from agents. This is a secret key that should be kept private. If you omit this, a random key will be generated for you. Base URL baseUrl The . The external URL for SUSE Observability that users and agents will use to connect. For example https://suse-observability.internal. If you haven’t decided on an Ingress configuration yet, use http://localhost:8080. This can be updated later in the generated file. Username and password** -u -p The username and password used by SUSE Observability to pull images. For air-gapped environments these need to be the username and password for the local docker registry. License key license The SUSE Observability license key. Admin API password adminApiPassword The password for the admin API. Note that this API contains system maintenance functionality and should only be accessible by the maintainers of the SUSE Observability installation. If you omit this, a random password will be generated for you. If you do pass this value and it’s not bcrypt hashed, the chart will hash it for you. Default password adminPassword The password for the default user (admin) to access SUSE Observability’s UI. If you omit this, a random password will be generated for you. If you do pass this value and it’s not bcrypt hashed, the chart will hash it for you. Image Registry imageRegistry The registry where the SUSE Observability images are hosted. If not provided, the default value will be 'quay.io' Pull Secret Username pullSecret.username The username used to pull images from the Docker registry where the SUSE Observability images are hosted. Pull Secret Password pullSecret.password The password used to pull images from the Docker registry where the SUSE Observability images are hosted. Sizing generate sizing.generate Switch on or off the generation of the sizing_values.yaml file. Sizing profile sizing.profile OneOf 10-nonha, 20-nonha, 50-nonha, 100-nonha, 150-ha, 250-ha, 500-ha. Based on this profiles the sizing_values.yaml file is generated containing default sizes for the SUSE Observability resources and configuration to be deployed on an Ha or NonHa mode. E.g. 10-nonha will produce a sizing_values.yaml meant to deploy a NonHa SUSE Observability instance to observe a 10 node cluster in a Non High Available mode. Currently moving from a nonha to an ha environment is not possible, so if you expect that your environment willrequire to observe around 150 nodes then better to go with ha immediately. Store the generated basicConfig.yaml and sizing_values.yaml files somewhere safe. You can reuse this files for upgrades, which will save time and (more importantly) will ensure that SUSE Observability continues to use the same API key. This is desirable as it means Agents and other data providers for SUSE Observability won’t need to be updated. The files can be regenerated independently using the switches basicConfig.generate=false and sizing.generate=false to disable any of them while still keeping the previosuly generated version of the file in the output-dir. Because OpenShift has stricter security model than plain Kubernetes, all of the standard security contexts in the deployment need to be disabled. Create a Helm values file openshift-values.yaml with the following content and store it next to the generated values.yaml file. This contains the values that are needed for an OpenShift deployment. elasticsearch: prometheus-elasticsearch-exporter: podSecurityContext: \"\" sysctlInitContainer: enabled: false scc: enabled: true The recommended deployment of SUSE Observability is a production ready, high availability setup with many services running redundantly.

However, to install SUSE Observability successfully, you need some additional privileges, or ensure that the requirements described in this page are met. To allow communication between SUSE Observability services SUSE Observability uses Kubernetes service accounts. To be able to verify their validity and roles the helm chart creates a ClusterRole and a ClusterRoleBinding resources. Creating these cluster-wide resources is often prohibited for users that aren’t a Kubernetes/OpenShift administrator. For that case the creation can be disabled and instead the roles and role bindings need to be created manually by your cluster admin. The automatic creation of cluster-wide resources during installation of SUSE Observability can be disabled by adding the following section to the values.yaml file used to install SUSE Observability: {% tabs %} {% tab title=\"values.yaml\" %} cluster-role: enabled: false {% endtab %} {% endtabs %} If the creation of the cluster role and cluster role binding has been disabled please make sure to follow the instructions below to manually create them using the instructions below. If you need to manually create the cluster-wide resources, ask your Kubernetes/OpenShift administrator to create the 3 resources below in the clsuter. Verify that you specify the correct service account and namespace for the bound ServiceAccount for both of the ClusterRoleBinding resources. The example assumes the suse-observability namespace is used and that suse-observability is used as the release, if some other namespace is used changed the namespace in the examples.

There are some additional requirements for the nodes that Elasticsearch runs on. As the vm.max_map_count Linux system setting is usually lower than required for Elasticsearch to start, an init container is used that runs in privileged mode and as the root user. The init container is enabled by default to allow the vm.max_map_count system setting to be changed. In case you or your Kubernetes/OpenShift administrators don’t want the privileged Elasticsearch init container to be enabled by default, you can disable this behavior in the file values.yaml used to install SUSE Observability: {% tabs %} {% tab title=\"values.yaml\" %} elasticsearch: sysctlInitContainer: enabled: false {% endtab %} {% endtabs %} If this is disabled, you will need to ensure that the vm.max_map_count setting is changed from its common default value of 65530 to 262144. If this isn’t done, Elasticsearch will fail to start up and its pods will be in a restart loop. To inspect the current vm.max_map_count setting, run the following command. Note that it runs a privileged pod: kubectl run -i --tty sysctl-check-max-map-count --privileged=true --image=busybox --restart=Never --rm=true -- sysctl vm.max_map_count If the current vm.max_map_count setting isn’t at least 262144, it will need to be increased in a different way or Elasticsearch will fail to start up and its pods will be in a restart loop. The logs will contain an error message like this: bootstrap checks failed max virtual memory areas vm.max_map_count [65530] is too low, increase to at least [262144] Depending on what your Kubernetes/OpenShift administrators prefer, the vm.max_map_count can be set to a higher default on all nodes by either changing the default node configuration (for example via init scripts) or by having a DaemonSet do this right after node startup. The former is very dependent on your clsuter setup, so there are no general solutions there. Below is an example that can be used as a starting point for a DaemonSet to change the vm.max_map_count setting: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: name: set-vm-max-map-count labels: k8s-app: set-vm-max-map-count spec: selector: matchLabels: name: set-vm-max-map-count template: metadata: labels: name: set-vm-max-map-count spec: # Make sure the setting always gets changed as soon as possible: tolerations: - effect: NoSchedule operator: Exists - effect: NoExecute key: node.kubernetes.io/not-ready operator: Exists # Optional node selector (assumes nodes for Elasticsearch are labeled `elasticsearch:yes` # nodeSelector: # elasticsearch: yes initContainers: - name: set-vm-max-map-count image: busybox securityContext: runAsUser: 0 privileged: true command: [\"sysctl\", \"-w\", \"vm.max_map_count=262144\"] resources: limits: cpu: 100m memory: 100Mi requests: cpu: 100m memory: 100Mi # A pause container is needed to prevent a restart loop of the pods in the daemonset # See also this Kubernetes issue https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/36601 containers: - name: pause image: google/pause resources: limits: cpu: 50m memory: 50Mi requests: cpu: 50m memory: 50Mi To limit the number of nodes that this is applied to, nodes can be labeled.

The auto instrumentation configured via environment variables only supports traces until this Open Telemetry issue is resolved. To enable metrics from the automatic instrumentation code changes are needed. Please follow the instructions in the Open Telemetry documentation to make these changes. Manual instrumentation can be used when you need metrics, traces or logs from parts of the code that are not supported by the auto instrumentation. For example unsupported libraries, in-house code or business-level metrics. To capture that data you need to modify your application. Include the Open Telemetry SDK as a dependency Add code to your application to capture metrics, spans or logs where needed There is detailed documentation for this on the Open Telemetry Javascript SDK doc pages. Make sure you use the OTLP exporter and configure the exporter endpoint correctly from the code. See also the Open Telemetry documentation.

The following diagram describes the authentication flow. Before you can configure SUSE Observability to authenticate using KeyCloak, you need to add a new client configuration to the KeyCloak Authentication Server. The necessary settings for the client are: Client ID - The ID of the client that’s connecting, we recommend naming this stackstate Client Protocol - Set to openid-connect Access Type - Set to confidential, so that a secret is used to establish the connection between KeyCloak and SUSE Observability Standard Flow Enabled - Set to Enabled Implicit Flow Enabled - Set to Disabled Root URL - The root location of SUSE Observability (the same value configured in as base URL of the SUSE Observability configuration Valid redirect URIs - This should be /loginCallback/* Base URL - This should point to the root location of SUSE Observability To configure SUSE Observability to authenticate using KeyCloak, KeyCloak details and user role mapping needs to be added to the file authentication.yaml. For example: stackstate: authentication: keycloak: url: \"https://keycloak.acme.com/auth\" realm: acme authenticationMethod: client_secret_basic clientId: stackstate secret: \"8051a2e4-e367-4631-a0f5-98fc9cdc564d\" jwsAlgorithm: RS256 # scope is optional.

Verify the Client scopes on your KeyCloak instance to be sure that the default scope is correct or you need a custom one. Follow the steps below to configure SUSE Observability to authenticate using KeyCloak: In authentication.yaml - add details of the KeyCloak authentication provider (see the example above). The KeyCloak specific values can be obtained from the client configuration in KeyCloak: url - The base URI for the KeyCloak instance realm - The KeyCloak realm to connect to authenticationMethod - Set to client_secret_basic, this is currently the only supported value. clientId - The ID of the KeyCloak client as configured in KeyCloak secret - The secret attached to the KeyCloak client, which is used to authenticate this client to KeyCloak redirectUri - Optional: The URI where the login callback endpoint of SUSE Observability is reachable. Populated by default using the stackstate.baseUrl, but can be overridden (must be a fully qualified URL that points to the /loginCallback path) jwsAlgorithm - Set this to RS256, this is currently the only supported value. jwtClaims - Optional: The roles or username can be retrieved from a different attribute than the Keycloak default behavior usernameField - Optional: The field in the OIDC user profile that should be used as the username. By default, this will be the preferred_username. groupsField - Optional: SUSE Observability will always, and by default only, use the roles Keycloak provides.

Use the following settings for the client (if needed by the OIDC provider): Use the OIDCAuthoirzation Flow Set the Redirect URI to the base URL of SUSE Observability suffixed with /loginCallback. For example https://stackstate.acme.com/loginCallback. For some OIDC providers, such as Google, the Redirect URI must match exactly, including any query parameters. In that case, you should configure the URI like this https://stackstate.acme.com/loginCallback?client_name=StsOidcClient. Give SUSE Observability access to at least the scopes openid and email or the equivalent of these for your OIDC provider. SUSE Observability needs OIDC offline access. For some identity providers, this requires an extra scope, usually called offline_access. The result of this configuration should produce a clientId and a secret. Copy those and keep them around for configuring SUSE Observability. Also write down the discoveryUri of the provider. Usually this is either in the same screen or can be found in the documentation. To configure SUSE Observability to use an OIDC authentication provider on Kubernetes, OIDC details and user role mapping needs to be added to the file authentication.yaml.

Normally also documented or returned when creating the client in the OIDC provider. jwsAlgorithm - The default for OIDC is RS256. If your OIDC provider uses a different one, it can be set here. scope - Should match, or be a subset of, the scope provided in the OIDC provider configuration. SUSE Observability uses this to request access to these parts of a user profile in the OIDC provider. redirectUri - Optional (not in the example): The URI where the login callback endpoint of SUSE Observability is reachable. Populated by default using the stackstate.baseUrl, but can be overridden. This must be a fully qualified URL that points to the /loginCallback path. customParameters - Optional map of key/value pairs that are sent to the OIDC provider as custom request parameters. Some OIDC providers require extra request parameters not sent by default. jwtClaims - usernameField - The field in the OIDC user profile that should be used as the username. By default, this will be the preferred_username, however, many providers omit this field. A good alternative is email. groupsField - The field from which SUSE Observability will read the role/group for a user.

A role describes a group of users that can access a specific data set. SUSE Observability ships with a set of predefined roles and you can also create roles to match your needs. There are four roles predefined in SUSE Observability: Administrator - has full access to all views and has all permissions, except for platform management. Platform Administrator - has platform management permissions and access to all views. Power User - typically granted to a user that needs to configure SUSE Observability for a team(s), but won’t manage the entire SUSE Observability installation. Kubernetes Troubleshooter - has all permissions required to use SUSE Observability for troubleshooting, including the ability to enable/disable monitors, create custom views and use the Cli. Guest - has read-only access to SUSE Observability. The permissions assigned to each predefined SUSE Observability role can be found below.

There are multiple ways to add custom roles: via the configuration file, with the same permission as the predefined roles via the configuration file, with a custom scope and custom system and view permissions using the sts CLI, the subjects and their permissions are stored in the database and can be modified during runtime Roles added via the configuration file require a restart and therefore result in a short period of downtime. Roles created using the CLI are stored in the database and can be modified at runtime. Use this option when the predefined SUSE Observability roles are a good fit but the external authentication provider has different names for the roles. For example when the LDAP authentication provider has similar but differently named roles include this YAML snippet in an authentication.yaml to give the roles from LDAP the same permissions and scopes as the predefined, equivalent, roles. stackstate: authentication: roles: guest: [\"ldap-guest-role\"] powerUser: [\"ldap-power-user-role\"] admin: [\"ldap-admin-role\"] k8sTroubleshooter: [\"ldap-troubleshooter-role\"] platformAdmin: [\"ldap-platform-admin-role\"] To use it in for your SUSE Observability installation (or already running instance, note that it will restart the API): helm upgrade \\ --install \\ --namespace suse-observability \\ --values values.yaml \\ --values authentication.yaml \\ suse-observability \\ suse-observability/suse-observability To set up a new role called development-troubleshooter, which will allow the same permissions as the predefined troubleshooter role, but only for the dev-test cluster, include this YAML snippet in an authentication.yaml: stackstate: authentication: roles: custom: development-troubleshooter: systemPermissions: - access-cli - create-views - execute-component-actions - export-settings - manage-monitors - manage-notifications - manage-stackpacks - manage-star-view - perform-custom-query - read-agents - read-metrics - read-permissions - read-settings - read-system-notifications - read-telemetry-streams - read-traces - run-monitors - update-visualization - view-metric-bindings - view-monitors - view-notifications viewPermissions: - access-view - save-view - delete-view topologyScope: \"label = 'kube_cluster_name:dev-test'\" # Optional, leave out when the scope should be all topology To use it in for your SUSE Observability installation (or already running instance, note that it will restart the API): helm upgrade \\ --install \\ --namespace suse-observability \\ --values values.yaml \\ --values authentication.yaml \\ suse-observability \\ suse-observability/suse-observability To set up a new role called development-troubleshooter, which will allow the same permissions as the normal troubleshooter role, but only for the dev-test cluster, a new subject needs to be created. Further more this subject needs to be assigned the required set of permissions: Create the subject (with the same name as the role, the role-subject matching is name based and case-sensitive): sts rbac create-subject --subject development-troubleshooter --scope 'label = \"kube_cluster_name:dev-test\"' Please note that when passing an topology query in a CLI command, all operators (like =, <,AND, and so on) need to be surrounded by spaces, as in the above example. Configured subjects need permissions to access parts of the UI and to execute actions in it. To grant the same permissions as the troubleshooter role, follow the below example: # To grant permission to access any view use the special view name 'everything' sts rbac grant --subject development-troubleshooter --permission access-view --resource \"everything\" sts rbac grant --subject development-troubleshooter --permission save-view --resource \"everything\" sts rbac grant --subject development-troubleshooter --permission delete-view --resource \"everything\" sts rbac grant --subject development-troubleshooter --permission access-cli sts rbac grant --subject development-troubleshooter --permission create-views sts rbac grant --subject development-troubleshooter --permission execute-component-actions sts rbac grant --subject development-troubleshooter --permission export-settings sts rbac grant --subject development-troubleshooter --permission manage-monitors sts rbac grant --subject development-troubleshooter --permission manage-notifications sts rbac grant --subject development-troubleshooter --permission manage-stackpacks sts rbac grant --subject development-troubleshooter --permission manage-star-view sts rbac grant --subject development-troubleshooter --permission perform-custom-query sts rbac grant --subject development-troubleshooter --permission read-agents sts rbac grant --subject development-troubleshooter --permission read-metrics sts rbac grant --subject development-troubleshooter --permission read-permissions sts rbac grant --subject development-troubleshooter --permission read-settings sts rbac grant --subject development-troubleshooter --permission read-system-notifications sts rbac grant --subject development-troubleshooter --permission read-telemetry-streams sts rbac grant --subject development-troubleshooter --permission read-traces sts rbac grant --subject development-troubleshooter --permission run-monitors sts rbac grant --subject development-troubleshooter --permission update-visualization sts rbac grant --subject development-troubleshooter --permission view-metric-bindings sts rbac grant --subject development-troubleshooter --permission view-monitors sts rbac grant --subject development-troubleshooter --permission view-notifications Please note that the subject’s name, as well as permissions, are case-sensitive.","title":"Roles","component":"observability","version":"next","name":"rbac_roles","url":"/observability/next/en/setup/security/rbac/rbac_roles.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Predefined roles","hash":"_predefined_roles","id":2},{"text":"Custom roles","hash":"_custom_roles","id":3},{"text":"Custom names for predefined roles","hash":"_custom_names_for_predefined_roles","id":4},{"text":"Custom roles with custom scopes and permissions via the configuration file","hash":"_custom_roles_with_custom_scopes_and_permissions_via_the_configuration_file","id":5},{"text":"Custom roles via the CLI","hash":"_custom_roles_via_the_cli","id":6}]},"109":{"id":109,"text":"The scope is an STQL query that’s added as a prefix to every query executed in SUSE Observability.

This limits the results accordingly to match the user’s role. Please note that function calls like withCauseOf and withNeighborsOf aren’t supported as they would not be performant in this context. If a user belongs to multiple groups, then this user can have multiple scopes, which translates to multiple prefixes. In this situation, the prefix is executed as an OR of all scopes that this user has.

Scopes are introduced as a security feature that’s mandatory for every subject within SUSE Observability.

It’s possible to specify a scope as a query wildcard, however, this will result in access to everything and isn’t recommended. If there is a need for access without a scope, it’s recommended to use one of the predefined roles instead.

The query for this view is the same as for the others, but without any prefix: 'layer = \"Infrastructure\" AND domain IN (\"Customer1\", \"Customer2\")' 'domain = \"Customer1\"' Query with the prefix for this view is: '(domain = \"Customer1\") AND (layer = \"Infrastructure\" AND domain IN (\"Customer1\", \"Customer2\"))' 'domain = \"Customer2\"' gets this topology: Query with the prefix for this view is: '(domain = \"Customer2\") AND (layer = \"Infrastructure\" AND domain IN (\"Customer1\", \"Customer2\"))' It’s possible to assign a subject to more than just one group. In this example, you can see an Infrastructure Manager who can see the whole view presented above. This user has to be in both groups that have configured subjects as X and Y.

It also has a link to the SUSE Observability UI that will open the component at the time of the health state change Event: the event that triggered this notification. It can either be of type open or close (see next section). An open state means that the monitor is still in a critical (or deviating) state for the specified component. A close state means that the monitor was open before but that the issue has been resolved. The state and triggered time are included. Also included is a title which is a short description of the problem as provided by the monitor, it is the same title shown in the highlights page of the component, this can be different and more detailed than the monitor name. Monitor: the monitor that triggered the notification. Next to the monitor name, tags and identifier also a link is included. The link will open the monitor in the SUSE Observability UI. Notification configuration: The notification configuration for this notification. Includes a name, identifier and link. The link will open the notification configuration in the SUSE Observability UI.

The type is now close and there is only a reason field indicating why the notification was closed. The value in this field is an enum, the OpenAPI specification documents the possible values. As can be seen from the payload each notification is uniquely identified by its notificationId. It’s possible, even common, to receive more than one message for the same notification, but they will always be sent according to this life cycle. A notification is first created when a monitor state changes to deviating or critical (whether deviating is applicable depends on the notification settings). A message with event type open is sent to the webhook. A notification can be updated when the state or the title in the event change. Changes to the component and other parts of the message will be included but on their own they won’t trigger an update. A notification update also sends a message with event type open to the webhook. The message will have the same notificationId which can be used to update the data in the external system (instead of creating a new notification). Finally a notification is closed when the monitor state changes back to a non-critical (or deviating) state. A message with event type close is sent to the webhook. This is also the last time that the specific notificationId is used. Note that a notification can be both opened and closed for different reasons than a health state change: A tag is added to a component or monitor. This can cause some critical monitor health state to match the selection criteria in a notification configuration and corresponding notifications will be opened. For the same reason removal of a tag from a component or monitor can close a notification even though the health state is still critical. Changes to the notification configuration itself can also result in many new notifications being opened or closed. The secret token specified in the channel configuration is included in the webhook requests in the X-SUSE Observability-Webhook-Token header. Your webhook endpoint can check the value to verify the requests is legitimate. The webhook channel will retry requests for a notification until it receives a status 200 OK response (the body in the response is ignored). If the webhook fails to process the message (for example because a database is unreachable right at the time) it can simply respond with a 500 status code. SUSE Observability will re-send the same message within a few seconds in the hope that the issue has been resolved now. If a notification was updated or closed the old message will however be discarded and the new, updated, message will be send and again retried until it succeeds. To test how webhooks work you can use this simply Python script that starts an HTTP server and writes the received payload to standard out. Save this Python script as webhook.py: from http.server import HTTPServer, BaseHTTPRequestHandler import json import sys class WebhookHTTPRequestHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler): def do_POST(self): content_len = int(self.headers.get('content-length', 0)) notification = json.loads(self.rfile.read(content_len)) print(\"Notification received: \", json.dumps(notification, indent = 2)) self.send_response(200) self.end_headers() httpd = HTTPServer(('', int(sys.argv[1])), WebhookHTTPRequestHandler) httpd.serve_forever() Run the webhook server on an unused port (for example 8000): python3 webhook.py 8000 Configure the webhook in SUSE Observability with the URL for your webhook server http://webhook.example.com:8000 Click test on the webhook channel The URL for your webhook must be accessible by SUSE Observability, so a localhost address or a local ip-address won’t be enough. The example doesn’t authenticate the request, which can be added by verifying the value of the token header. Instead of implenting this by hand it’s also possible to use the OpenAPI specification to generate a server implementation in any of the languages supported by the OpenAPI generators project.
